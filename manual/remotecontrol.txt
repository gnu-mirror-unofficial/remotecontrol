GNU remotecontrol
*****************

This manual is for GNU remotecontrol (version 1.00, 17 December 2012).

1 Overview
**********

GNU remotecontrol is a web application serving as a management tool for
multiple IP enabled HVAC thermostats (device), and other Building
Automation devices. The purpose of GNU remotecontrol is to read from
and write to multiple IP enabled thermostats all at one time.

   The GNU remotecontrol framework is designed to work with any IP
enabled HVAC thermostat, but can be easily developed to operate any
number of networked devices. This framework is built with cURL
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), PHP
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), and MySQL
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL). Its system architecture is
enabled on a server-client principle, where users can login to the
server using a web browser to manage multiple remote devices from a
single web interface. The GNU remotecontrol framework was developed to
work in combination with a Remote Monitoring Server, which monitors
configurable device parameters and can generate automatic system
responses and alerts. If required, the GNU remotecontrol is both
scalable and distributable over multiple computers serving different
roles in the HVAC or remote device management framework. The Proliphix
(http://www.proliphix.com/) IP thermostat (currently the only true IP
enabled HVAC thermostat on the market) was used to develop the GNU
remotecontrol web application. The Application Programming Interface
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (API)
*Proliphix IP Devices HTTP API, Revision 1.8* is used to read from and
write to the Object Identification (OID) numbers defined in the API for
the thermostat device.

   The intended structure of this documentation is to provide as much
assistance as possible to understanding *why* you need/want to use GNU
remotecontrol and instruction for *how* to use GNU remotecontrol. Our
research during the development of GNU remotecontrol found users
operated best when they were given the opportunity to gain a high-level
understanding of all the technologies associated with GNU
remotecontrol. This documentation is written as a combined reference
manual and technical manual for GNU remotecontrol. The *Scope* section
contains a listing of the minimum recommended chapter reading, per
role. Each section in *System Architecture and Concepts* contains
instructions for *Security Model*, any *Options* that are recommended,
*Requirements* to run that technology, and *Configuration* of that
technology.

   We recognize this documentation contains a lot of material. The
documentation is segmented for you to select what you need to read to
get going with GNU remotecontrol. We have done all we know how to
structure this documentation in a Table of Contents that helps you
easily find what you are looking for, obtain a complete understanding
of each role, and master the minimum recommended chapter reading as
simply and quickly as possible. It is our hope you find this
documentation contains all of the information you need to successfully
and effortlessly use GNU remotecontrol. With that said, we give you GNU
remotecontrol.

2 Scope
*******

The scope of this documentation is to address the 3 roles that function
daily in the usage of GNU remotecontrol; *Information Technology*,
*Energy Management*, and *End User*. A 4th role, *Financial
Management*, is a role that operates in the Cost Benefit Analysis
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) and in
reviews to evaluate facility improvement opportunities. The
documentation contains information pertinent to each role. The intended
end result is to help equip each role with the necessary definitions
and reference information to further high-level communication among the
roles.

   The following list is the minimum recommended chapter reading, per
role.

3 Key Principles
****************

3.1 Present Capabilities
========================

GNU remotecontrol is designed to substantially reduce the time & effort
necessary to remotely manage multiple IP thermostats, while
significantly increasing your productivity through its many useful and
time saving features. The User Interface is no more difficult than
using any other web application involving simple check boxes and
pull-down menus. GNU remotecontrol, combined with the Remote Monitoring
Server, work together as a complete HVAC energy management system. GNU
remotecontrol more than pays for itself by saving time/effort in manual
labor for managing all resources individually.....and then some.

3.2 HVAC Thermostat
===================

It is necessary to understand the design and usage intent of the HVAC
thermostat to fully grasp the design and usage intent of GNU
remotecontrol.

   The HVAC thermostat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thermostat) is
often a combination of either a relay
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay) or a semiconductor device
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device) to have circuits
either opened or closed, off or on. Examples of this include heating,
cooling, or a fan. The addition of a scheduling option to turn any of
these items off or on at a certain date/time does make it more
practical of a device in terms of managing day-to-day operation of a
HVAC system. Adding in the ability to track run time duration for
heating, cooling, or a fan help energy efficiency measurements. The
final addition of remote access, through the traditional IP enabled
data network, takes the HVAC thermostat to an interconnected device
capable of multiple read/write techniques. The cable from the
thermostat to the HVAC equipment is solid core 18-AWG
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge), either 4 or 8
separately jacketed wires, depending on system capability, all
contained within a protective jacket.

3.3 Choosing Decision Makers
============================

You will most likely need to work with others who have a different
skill set than you do to achieve an effective energy management
strategy. It is necessary to carefully plan for your selection of the
decision makers you choose to work with. Choosing decision makers that
are capable to run your HVAC and IT systems is paramount to the success
of your system performance.

3.3.1 HVAC
----------

Being a licensed Professional Engineer
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_engineer) does not make that
person a Certified Energy Manager
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Energy_Manager) (CEM). They are
separate qualifications, each with their own requirements. Go with a
Certified Energy Manager to help you determine if you qualify for any
tax benefit for commercial building being rated as energy efficient.
Even if you don't qualify for a tax benefit, you will most likely find
a very beneficial set of methods to increase your energy management
strategies that makes paying the Certified Energy Manger well worth the
expense.

3.3.2 Information Technology
----------------------------

Being in an IT role does not make one qualified do an end-to-end design
of an IT system. Relevant certifications help to know if one is really
capable to do what they say they can do. Experience is probably the
strongest credential one can have for being capable to run an IT
system. Simply put, operation does not equal design. They are separate
qualifications, each with their own requirements.

3.3.3 Conclusion
----------------

Look to your *Cost Benefit Analysis* for decision making on how you
need to design and operate your energy management strategy.

3.4 Security Considerations
===========================

The following is a list of information that will greatly help you plan
for the network implementation and configuration of your energy
management strategy.

3.4.1 Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
----------------------------------------------

SCADA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) speaks to the industrial
side of HVAC automation.

3.4.2 Industrial Control System
-------------------------------

ICS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Control_Systems) speaks to
industrial production facilities.

3.4.3 System Administration-Audit-Network Security
--------------------------------------------------

SANS (http://www.sans.org/) specializes in Internet Security training.

3.5 Frequently Asked Questions
==============================

3.5.1 Why do we call it GNU remotecontrol?
------------------------------------------

This code was originally called *JUT*....."*J*ust *U*se *T*his" to
represent the intention of this software automation to take the
complicated and make it very, very simple, from a user perspective. The
name changed to GNU remotecontrol, when code was released under the GNU
license.

3.5.2 Why do I need GNU remotecontrol?
--------------------------------------

If you have IP thermostats, you know that it takes time/effort to keep
your energy usage down and control your climate for your comfort. This
time and effort is increased with each remote device or HVAC unit that
you want to administrate. GNU remotecontrol helps you spend less
time/effort administrating your IP thermostats, provides automated
record keeping of what changed, who changed it, and when it was
changed. GNU remotecontrol deployment helps keep your energy usage as
low as possible.

3.5.3 How do I know who changed what?
-------------------------------------

The access logs of your Web Server, your Operating System, and all of
the other technologies that achieve user validation of a web
application. Technologies that are time tested, tried and true, that
you can count on. No need to reinvent the wheel, use what works very
well when possible.

3.5.4 What will GNU remotecontrol do for me?
--------------------------------------------

Free up your time/effort for starters. Also, enable you to know who did
what to your IP thermostats when GNU remotecontrol was used to change
your IP thermostats. Finally, your GNU remotecontrol application can
help you minimize your energy costs.

3.5.5 Can I figure my energy usage for my HVAC units?
-----------------------------------------------------

The IP thermostat will very much help with that measurement.

3.5.6 How do I use GNU remotecontrol?
-------------------------------------

Pretty easy, actually. Select the IP thermostats you want to change the
settings of.....make the change.....and that's it. You can easily see
the time/effort you save changing the air conditioning from 75oF to
73oF for several IP thermostats, all at once!  Then, imagine changing
your setback schedule somehow on top of that, for say 30 different IP
thermostats, all at once!

3.5.7 Can I use GNU remotecontrol and Remote Monitoring Server together?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh, yes. Think of GNU remotecontrol as writing to your IP thermostats,
and Remote Monitoring Server reading information about your IP
thermostats. The two go hand in hand. They are intended to work
together.

3.5.8 What about the weather, can I tie weather related data into GNU remotecontrol and Remote Monitoring Server?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Use your Remote Monitoring Server to collect information about the
weather from International Weather Services for the location of your IP
thermostat. That will tell you a great deal about the quality of your
energy management strategy.

3.5.9 Mobile access for GNU remotecontrol?
------------------------------------------

Yes, but that depends on who you have for cell phone service, the type
of cell phone you have, and the Internet browser on that phone.

3.5.10 Do I need to install anything to my computer?
----------------------------------------------------

No. GNU remotecontrol is a WC3 (http://www.w3.org/standards/) compliant
web application. More times than not, your network is ready to go as-is.

3.5.11 How many different users will be able to use GNU remotecontrol?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can set up different user accounts, but the nature of an IP
thermostat means the people touching it be very clear with each other
as to how they want to set the IP thermostat.

3.5.12 Encryption.....is GNU remotecontrol safe to use with my network?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend you use a High Grade (AES-256 bit) encryption to secure
the connection from your computer to your GNU remotecontrol server and
verify the identity of your server with your own signed SSL
Certificate. The connection from your computer to your IP thermostat is
not changed from your normal connection to your Proliphix IP thermostat.

3.5.13 Is GNU remotecontrol compatible with BACnet?
---------------------------------------------------

Yes. *Note GNU remotecontrol & BACnet::.

3.5.14 Can I use GNU remotecontrol to help Test & Balance my HVAC system?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Remote Monitoring Server & GNU remotecontrol work together to help
you do just this. Recorded data of your HVAC system's usage and outdoor
weather information is priceless for testing & balancing. The review of
recorded data offers considerable cost savings, in both time and
effort, to when optimizing your system setup. Additionally, you can
reduce the number of people necessary to do the testing and balancing
down to 1 person.

3.6 Future Capabilities
=======================

The next logical step is to expand GNU remotecontrol and become
certified with industrial HVAC, lighting control, access control, and
fire detection technologies. The BACnet communication protocol is an
excellent candidate for connection to the GNU remotecontrol framework.
*Note GNU remotecontrol & BACnet::. The MODBUS
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) communication protocol may also
be implemented at a future date, but demand for this capability
enhancement is not clearly understood.

4 GNU remotecontrol & BACnet
****************************

4.1 Introduction
================

The BACnet (http://www.bacnet.org/) data communication protocol of
ASHRAE (http://www.ashrae.org/) provides the BACnet XML Working Group
(http://www.bacnet.org/WG/XML/index.html).

4.2 Associated Specifications
=============================

The following is a list of information that will greatly help you plan
for the usage of the data captured in your energy management strategy.



   * 	 *Extensible Markup Language* - XML
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)

     	 _"The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality,
     and usability over the Internet. It is a textual data format with
     strong support via Unicode for the languages of the world.
     Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used
     for the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example
     in web services."_

     	 _"XML documents consist entirely of characters from the
     Unicode repertoire. Except for a small number of specifically
     excluded control characters, any character defined by Unicode may
     appear within the content of an XML document."_



   * 	 *Representational State Transfer* - REST
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

     	 _"Unlike SOAP-based web services, there is no "official"
     standard for RESTful web services. This is because REST is an
     architecture, unlike SOAP, which is a protocol. Even though REST
     is not a standard, a RESTful implementation such as the Web can
     use standards like HTTP, URI, XML, etc."_



   * 	 *BACnet* ADDENDA AND COMPANION STANDARDS
     (http://www.bacnet.org/Addenda/index.html)




        * 		Addendum 135-2008al
          (http://www.bacnet.org/Addenda/Add-135-2010al-PPR3-Draft-4_chair_approved.pdf)



        * 		Addendum 2004-135c
          (http://www.bacnet.org/Addenda/Add-2004-135c.pdf)



        * 		Addendum 135-2010am
          (http://www.bacnet.org/Addenda/Add-135-2010am-APR1-1_chair-approved.pdf)



   * 	 *The Native PHP* XML Parser
     (http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.xml.php)

4.3 Going Forward
=================

The roadmap of GNU remotecontrol is a commitment to International
standards and protocols for Information Technology to provide
availability, relevance, transparency, and maintenance of the GNU
remotecontrol framework. (*Note Roadmap::.)  The BACnet XML Working
Group is an excellent example of these attributes.

5 Tax Benefit
*************

Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2006-26
(http://www.irs.gov/irb/2006-26_IRB/ar11.html), *Notice 2006-52*,
_Deduction for Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings_ defines the tax
deduction allowed for the hardware and software required for GNU
remotecontrol to operate in commercial buildings in the United States.
The costs for GNU remotecontrol are 100% tax deductible.....if you meet
these requirements. The tax deduction, combined with spending less
money for energy due to an improved energy management strategies, means
GNU remotecontrol more than pays for itself.

6 System Architecture and Concepts
**********************************

The following pieces of the GNU remotecontrol architecture are
*necessary*.


   * 	 Web Server

   * 	 Database Server

   The following pieces of the GNU remotecontrol architecture are
*optional*.


   * 	 Remote Monitoring Server

   * 	 Email Server

6.1 Web Server
==============

GNU remotecontrol uses PHP v5.3.9 and MySQL v5.5.2, in combination with
cURL v7.28.1, running without difficulty on either Windows or Linux.

6.1.1 Security Model
--------------------

GNU remotecontrol is configured with the security necessary for any
other Web Server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server). You are
responsible for setting up your security on your Web Server.

6.1.2 Requirements
------------------

GNU remotecontrol can run anywhere that can run PHP with cURL and MySQL.

   GNU remotecontrol runs without any known problems on Apache
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server) and IIS
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services). Running
GNU remotecontrol on a lightweight
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_lightweight_web_servers)
Web Server versus a complete
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_servers) Web Server is
possible, but not recommended. This is due to the security benefits of
a complete Web Server. Again, you are responsible for setting up your
security on your Web Server.

6.1.3 Configuration
-------------------

Follow the configuration stated by the Web Server you so choose to use.

   Here is what you need for running GNU remotecontrol on Apache, after
you setup your security on your Web Server.




   * 	*Apache httpd.config:*

     	Options FollowSymLinks

     	AllowOverride None

     	Order allow,deny 	Allow from all

     	AuthType Digest

     	AuthName "tstat"

     	AuthUserFile "PATH_TO...../passwords_digest"

     	Require user [Same user account name you setup for your
     database user account.]



   * 	*Settings necessary in your PHP configuration (php.ini):*

     	register_globals = Off

     	auto_globals_jit = On



   * 	*Extensions necessary in your PHP installation:*

     	php_curl

     	php_mysqli

6.2 Database Server
===================

GNU remotecontrol uses PHP v5.3.9 and MySQL v5.5.2, in combination with
cURL v7.28.1, running without difficulty on either Windows or Linux.

   It is important to consider the option of a Federated Database
System (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_database_system). This
option provides for the benefit of leveraging other Database Systems to
work with your GNU remotecontrol database. You are not bound to only
use MySQL for your GNU remotecontrol. Thinking outside of the box here
will most likely bring you innovation of how you can implement your GNU
remotecontrol.

6.2.1 Security Model
--------------------

GNU remotecontrol is configured with the security necessary for any
other Database System (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_system).
You are responsible for setting up your security on your Database
Server.

6.2.2 Requirements
------------------

Follow the requirements stated by the Database System you so choose to
use.

   GNU remotecontrol runs without any known problems on MySQL. Running
GNU remotecontrol on a lightweight
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-end_database#Small_Database_Systems)
Database Server versus a complete
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems)
Database Server is possible, but not recommended. This is due to the
security benefits of a complete Database Server. Again, you are
responsible for setting up your security on your Database Server.

6.2.3 Configuration
-------------------

Follow the requirements stated by the Database System you so choose to
use.

   There is only 1 database script, _iptstat.sql_. This is in the
folder _/dbscripts_. This script builds the GNU remotecontrol database.
From there, you apply your security model as you see fit.

6.2.4 Translations
------------------

All databases have a character set and collation setting that can be
configured to handle languages with special characters. The Character
Sets and Collations
(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/charset-charsets.html) specify
what you can add to your tables. This does not have to be a global
setting. This can be table-specific or even column-specific.

   GNU remotecontrol is built to display in any language you can get
into the database. You can also edit the contents, as you prefer, with
wording that is more appropriate for your end-users. This will help
ease your usage of GNU remotecontrol.

6.3 Remote Monitoring Server
============================

GNU remotecontrol uses PHP v5.3.9 and MySQL v5.5.2, in combination with
cURL v7.28.1, running without difficulty on either Windows or Linux.

6.3.1 Security Model
--------------------

GNU remotecontrol is configured with the security necessary for any
other Remote Monitoring
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_monitoring) application. You are
responsible for setting up your security on your Remote Monitoring
Server.

6.3.2 Options
-------------

The question must be answered.....*why would you not monitor your
systems*?  If your answer contents you to not have a Remote Monitoring
Server, so be it. Perhaps you trust the decisions and work of others
enough to not bother with setting up a Remote Monitoring Server. That
is often a poor choice.

   Running a Remote Monitoring Server is the easy part of having a
Remote Monitoring Server. The biggest decision you have to make
is.....* are you going to run it, or is someone else*?  Then, and only
then, choose the technology combination you want to have for your
Remote Monitoring Server. Do not let your skill set alone decide what
is best for meeting your needs. Determine what you needs are, count the
cost, and then choose your technology.

   We have developed plugins for Nagios that quite nicely round out the
energy management strategy. Check out the *Nagios Plugins*.

   *Popular Options*




   * 	 Nagios (http://www.nagios.org/)

   * 	 Solar Winds (http://www.solarwinds.com/)

   * 	 M/Monit (http://www.mmonit.com/)

     Note:: There are many, many other options to choose.

6.3.3 Requirements
------------------

Follow the requirements stated by the Remote Monitoring application you
so choose to use.

6.3.4 Configuration
-------------------

Follow the configuration stated by the Remote Monitoring application
you so choose to use

6.4 Nagios Plugins
==================

We have developed 2 plugins to round out the GNU remotecontrol
Architecture. The outcome of these plugins is to capture numbers
related to your IP enabled thermostat and RSS feeds for weather
information out of doors. Numbers are so much easier for processing
data to achieve knowledge. Text, images, video, and so on are on quite
complicated to process into knowledge. The metrics of Temperature
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature), Humidity
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity), Wind-Speed
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed), Wind-Chill
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill), and Atmospheric (Barometric)
Pressure (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_pressure) help to
analyze your entire HVAC system and determine if your energy management
strategy is working for you. Other metrics can be added in as
preferred, as shared below.

6.4.1 Proliphix Alarms
----------------------

The Proliphix thermostat device has 4 alarms.


   * 	 Low Temperature

   * 	 High Temperature

   * 	 High Humidity

   * 	 Filter Change

   Alarms in the thermostat device were considered for displaying in
index.php or another web page not developed (perhaps something like a
GNU remotecontrol alarms.php web page). Feedback from users during
development of GNU remotecontrol showed their preference is to be
informed of alarms from a Remote Monitoring Server notification. This
approach also provides logging of all monitored information, a feature
not available in the thermostat device.

   The Temperature and Humidity alarms are already provided for in the
Nagios checks we have developed. The Filter Change alarm has various
pre-determined options to select; 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, 365 Runtime
Days. This does not account for dust accumulating on a filter, should
the power be off to the thermostat device. This logic combination is
determined as insufficient to use for monitoring when to change the
filter of an HVAC system. Reasoning for this determination includes:


   * 	 Various pollutants enter filters at different times in
     different ways.

   * 	 Allergens are more prevalent in the Spring compared to the
     other seasons of the year.

   * 	 Dust is more common if a manufacturing facility has dust as a
     byproduct of manufacturing.

   * 	 Dust is generated from Wood Stoves and Fire Places. Heating
     needs often change throughout the year.

   * 	 Dust Storms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm) are
     common in arid and semi-arid regions. Dust Storms require
     additional filter inspections to make sure equipment will not be
     damaged from improper ventilation.

   * 	 An end-user is the best person to determine when to change a
     filter based upon the environmental conditions that may or may not
     change.

   The Proliphix API only supports reading these alarms, not setting an
alarm threshold or clearing an alarm event. The user must go to the web
server of the Proliphix thermostat device for setting an alarm
threshold or clearing an alarm event. Also, there is only a single
alarm issued per alarm type until the alarm type event is cleared in
the thermostat device. This logic combination means a threshold may be
exceeded, go back within the threshold, and then be exceeded again.
This example is an excellent illustration of the value gained by having
a Remote Motoring Server watching your network, your devices, and
anything else you can monitor.

   Finally, since the thermostat device has a threshold of how many
read events the unit can support per minute, we did not want to
overwhelm the device. An example of this overwhelming of the device is:


   * 	 Having a separate web page for viewing these alarms, after
     they are read from the thermostat device.

   * 	 Then, returning to index.php to see those alarms.....again.

   * 	 Then, going into the device to clear the alarm and/or adjust
     thresholds.

   * 	 Then, going back to index.php to see what an alarm reads.

   * 	 Then, going back into the separate to see what an alarm reads.

   The API is quite distinct about this cautioning of too many read
events per minute through the API. The combination of the web server of
the thermostat device and index.php is a proper approach to use back
and forth and not overwhelm the thermostat device.

6.4.2 Thermostat Plugin - check_ubicom
--------------------------------------

Please review the source code for each of these plugins to see detailed
instruction for proper usage. The following is an outline of the
detailed instruction.

   This plugin will attempt to read temperature and humidity from an IP
thermostat. Successful reads initially set the response to `STATE_OK'.
If the temperature or  humidity falls outside the range set by the
`warn-temperature' or the  `warn-humidity' arguments, then the response
is upgraded to `STATE_WARNING'. If the temperature or humidity falls
outside the range set by the `critical-temperature' or the
`critical-humidity' arguments, then the response is further upgraded to
`STATE_CRITICAL'. Failure to read both values (due to timeout or
parsing failure) results in a `STATE_UNKNOWN' response.

   Temperature and humidity arguments may specify a minimum, a maximum,
or both. A ':' character must be used to follow a minimum or precede a
maximum. For example.....

6.4.3 Weather Plugin - check_weather
------------------------------------

Please review the source code for each of these plugins to see detailed
instruction for proper usage. The following is an outline of the
detailed instruction.

   The check_weather plugin checks the wind-chill, wind-speed,
humidity, pressure, and temperature received from Yahoo! Weather RSS
Feed (http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/) for a single station code.
The return value is always OK or UNKNOWN.

   You are certainly free to use any other RSS feed you prefer.
Examples of this include The Weather Channel
(http://portal.theweatherchannel.com/) and Weather Underground
(http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/). All of these RSS feeds have
free and paid options. Please carefully read their provisions if you
select to use their RSS feed.

   The performance values returned by the check_weather plugin, *in

6.5 Email Server
================

6.5.1 Security Model
--------------------

GNU remotecontrol is configured with the security necessary for any
other Email Server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_server). You are
responsible for setting up your security on your Email Server.

6.5.2 Options
-------------

The email used in the GNU remotecontrol Architecture is for sending
email from your Remote Monitoring Server to you, via your Email Server.

   Options include either a Physical Server
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29), a Virtual Server
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_server), or an email service such
as DynDNS Email (http://www.dyn.com/email/) or Google Mail
(http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=13287) to
achieve what is necessary for the Email Server of the GNU remotecontrol
Architecture.

   Managing email activity is a full-time job. Managing Email Accounts
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_account), managing Electronic
Mailing List (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list) and
Distribution list (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_lists),
dealing with spam, viruses, and other security threats.....it really is
a lot to juggle. Do yourself a big favor and become very clear on these
3 items:


   * 	 Mail Delivery Agent
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_Delivery_Agent)

   * 	 Mail Transfer Agent
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_transfer_agent)

   * 	 Mail User Agent (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_user_agent)

   Then, do yourself a *very* big favor and become *very* familiar with
these 4 items:


   * 	 Email Authentication
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_authentication)

   * 	 S/MIME (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME)

   * 	 SMTP Authentication
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP_Authentication)

   * 	 Transport Layer Security
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)

   Check out Masquerading and Relaying
(http://www.sendmail.org/m4/masquerading.html) for mental expansion.
The combinations of running email on a single server are almost
limitless. Combining a Physical Server with a Virtual Server and
different email services make for assuring email is achieved about as
close to a certainty as possible.

6.5.3 Requirements
------------------

Follow the requirements stated by the Email application you so choose
to use.

   Please note that you do not need to get into encrypted email
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted_email), unless you want to. The
big difference is encrypted email encrypts the file in your email
client. The Email Authentication moves an un-encrypted email through an
encrypted means of transporting the said email. Think of it as a paper
letter in a paper envelope in a concrete hallway versus a paper letter
in a strong box in the middle of a city sidewalk.

   Now, having a familiarity understanding of these items will equip
you to have a very successful talk with your Email Administrator, or
your Internet Service Provider, or a Mail Relay Provider. That
administrator will ask you several questions about how you want email
handled for your GNU remotecontrol. Prepare beforehand for that
discussion. The discussion will go much better if you are familiar with
and understand these items.

6.5.4 Configuration
-------------------

Follow the configuration stated by the Email application you so choose
to use.

   The email you most likely will want is to be notified of a condition
occurring and you are notified by your Remote Monitoring Server. You do
not need to keep the email, nor do you need to do any reporting on the
emailing. All of the information you would ever need to report on lives
in your Remote Monitoring Server as either log files or a database. The
benefit of your email is to be notified when you need to look into
something, and that is all. The benefit of that awareness is priceless.
Combine that with managing those email notifications to you and others
in the lists of email addresses, a list that can and often changes,
makes email really valuable for managing the time of everyone involved.

     Note:: Don't use an SMS address when sending email to cell phones.
     Use the cell phone's email address via the Free Email To SMS
     Gateways (http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/email-to-sms/). Major
     United States Carriers offer this to both email and SMS users.
     Look for the same options of the cell phone provider's of the land
     in which you live. You will be much happier using the cell phone's
     email address, as you can easily track if the message went out or
     not, versus wondering about the SMS system.....in which knowing is
     often a mystery. Finally, it is 1 less system to work with.

6.6 Frequently Asked Questions
==============================

6.6.1 What is RMS?
------------------

RMS is the acronym of Remote Monitoring Server.

6.6.2 What is Remote Monitoring Server?
---------------------------------------

A Remote Monitoring Server regularly keeps track of your chosen
networked device (computers, email servers, web servers, routers, IP
thermostats, et cetera) and notifies you with alerts of any problems
when they occur.

6.6.3 Why do I need RMS?
------------------------

If you want to know the status of any IP addressable device, you need
to monitor it. If you do not have the time/effort available to stand
there and watch the device yourself, you need something to
automatically monitor it and record the results for you to review at
your leisure. Ideally, that Remote Monitoring Server will promptly
notify you of anything occurring that you have defined as a problem. An
automated technology that remotely monitors your equipment, commonly
referred to as....._stuff_.....and alerts you when there is a problem.
This is RMS.

6.6.4 What will RMS do for me?
------------------------------

Watch your "stuff" and tell you when your "stuff" has a problem. It
logs the results of the monitoring of your "stuff" for you to review in
a web page based format. That will help you figure out very quickly if
something is wrong and what is wrong with your "stuff".

6.6.5 How do I use RMS?
-----------------------

Pretty easy, actually. Setup your Remote Monitoring Server and decide
what network and devices you want monitored. From there, you receive an
email and/or SMS message to your cell phone when there is a problem.

6.6.6 Does a Remote Monitoring Server do graphing?
--------------------------------------------------

Oh yes, yes indeed!

6.6.7 Mobile access for RMS?
----------------------------

Yes, but it depends on who you have for cell phone service, the type of
cell phone you have, and the Internet browser on that phone.

6.6.8 Is it difficult to use RMS?
---------------------------------

No more difficult than receiving an email or SMS message. From there,
looking at a web page to see the history of your monitoring activity,
if you like.

6.6.9 How many emails/SMS messages will I get?
----------------------------------------------

More than enough for you to know if and when there is a problem. A
notification system is almost limitless in how it can be configured for
you. A good example is not receiving all SMS message in the middle of
the night, but only the SMS messages you conclude you must have 'round
the clock. When you receive a notification, how many times you receive
a subsequent notification for the same failure, and who receives that
notifications.....all set up as you want.

6.6.10 How many different email addresses will you send me notifications to?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often, there is a primary and a secondary person in a monitoring
notification.Each person has an email address and an SMS address,
receiving email and SMS notifications to each address.....as you
prefer.  Or, it is sent to a Distribution List. The combination of
options are plentiful to send email, rest assured.

6.6.11 Can I use RMS to help Test & Balance my HVAC system?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes. RMS & GNU remotecontrol work together to help you do just this.
Having recorded data for your system usage and outdoors weather
information is priceless for testing & balancing. It offers
considerable cost savings, in both time and effort, to review recorded
data to optimize your system setup. Additionally, you can reduce the
number of people necessary to do the testing and balancing down to 1
person.

6.6.12 Do I need RMS?
---------------------

Not to sound silly, but RMS prevents a mess. It is impossible to
consciously improve anything without first measuring it. You may
stumble upon a way to improve it, but is that a pro-active approach to
managing anything? Of course not. To help improve things, RMS helps by
monitoring the status your resources. The unknown things of life can
crop in and cause problems. The faster you know about a problem, the
faster you can stop any damage that problem may cause. RMS helps you
take advantage of the opportunity to improve how you manage things, so
the chance of a problem returning becomes less likely.

6.6.13 Really, how do I know that I need RMS?
---------------------------------------------

If you worry about your "stuff", and your "stuff" has an IP address,
you need RMS.

7 Usage Instructions
********************

It is our hope the preceding chapters have given you the opportunity to
gain a high-level understanding of all the technologies associated with
GNU remotecontrol. You are now ready to learn how to use GNU
remotecontrol.

   Tool Tips (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooltip) are present on a
few of the form controls in GNU remotecontrol. Most GUI web browsers
require UTF-8 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) to display Tool
Tips. The encoding of the GNU remotecontrol database is ISO-8859-1
(Latin 1). Therefore, some characters of some display languages may not
properly render in the Tool Tips. There are 2 ways to resolve this
problem.

   * 	 Change the word in the database for the said Tool Tip to
     either another word, an abbreviation of the word, or an acronym of
     the word.

   * 	 Change the encoding of all of the GNU remotecontrol web pages
     and the GNU remotecontrol database to the encoding used by your
     GUI web browser.

   Please see the section below for more information regarding *Browser
Selection*.

7.1 Browser Selection
=====================

GNU remotecontrol is designed for usage with either Mozilla Firefox
(http://www.mozilla.org/), or with Konqueror
(http://www.konqueror.org/). Microsoft Internet Explorer
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer) (IE), though one of
the worlds first graphical
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_web_browser) options for a
web browser (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) and is credited
with helping to grow the Internet past text browsing
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_web_browsers), the
application IE (http://www.microsoft.com/ie) simply changes too much
and too often to deal with all of the inconsistencies of the browser
not being compliant with International Standards
(http://www.w3.org/standards/agents/browsers) of the World Wide Web. In
addition, IE only runs on the Windows operating system whereas GNU
remotecontrol runs on any server that can run PHP
(http://php.net/downloads.php).....of which there are many.

   Please review the various *Use Case Scenarios* prior to reading how
to go about using GNU remotecontrol. These examples will greatly help
you to see the value of using GNU remotecontrol.

7.2 Time
========

This section is quite important, perhaps the most important of all. The
absence of all devices being set to the same time often results in many
problems, problems which are often catastrophic in nature. We have
written this section to try to eliminate Clock Synchronization
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_synchronization) errors from
hindering the efficiency of your energy management strategy.

   The definition of Time can mean many things to many people. We
define Time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time) as _a dimension in
which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the
future, and the measure of durations of events and the intervals
between them_. Date is a collection of time. Daylight Savings Time
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) is the most common
occurrence of Time Change (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_change).
Time Dilation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) is not a
problem with HVAC operation, nor is the Hafele Keating Effect
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment), as
the facility is not traveling.

   The biggest problem with having multiple clocks is Clock Drift
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift) and the necessary correction
for Delta T (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-T) to account for
Terrestrial Time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time). This
Clock Drift problem is globally resolved when Daylight Savings Time
occurs. The time standard the majority of the world uses is Coordinated
Universal Time
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time), often
referred to as *UTC*. This time standard is achieved by the Atomic
Clock (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock) delivering
International Atomic Time
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time).

   Examples of how time differences can cause damage and harm people
are in a manufacturing facility
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time#Complexity) and
while using medical equipment
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/PublicHealthNotifications/ucm062068.htm).
Awareness during the Daylight Savings Time change is the easiest way to
avert any unforeseen problems. Remember, even if you don't live in a
location that observes Daylight Savings Time, there is still a time
correction that occurs to resolve Delta T. Finally, you may have newly
installed equipment that was incorrectly configured during installation
and erroneously activates the hourly time change when Daylight Savings
Time occurs.

   We decided to align the time of the thermostat to the time of the
GNU remotecontrol server, and have the Time Zone
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone) of each thermostat as a
required field in the thermostat profile. The Time Zone information
lives in the *timezoneoffset* table in the GNU remotecontrol database,
as a Greenwich Mean Time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmt) (GMT)
offset (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UTC_time_offsets). Please
read the sections for *index.php*, explaining the *Time Zone Offset*
field, and the section *Write to a Thermostat - Date and Time* for more
information about how we have accomplished this action. The capability
to use Database Management to manage your thermostats is very much
improved by having the Time Zone information as a field in your GNU
remotecontrol database.

   We originally developed code to enable setting each thermostat to a
specifically different time, but decided against using that option.
Setting each thermostat to a different time would defeat achieving
Clock Synchronization, resulting in loads of confusion when comparing
your HVAC logged data with logged data from other sources, such as
Weather Services, other Building Automation technologies, and Network
Security.

   *Reference Information*

   * 	 Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNTP)

   * 	 Network Time Protocol (NTP)
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol)

   * 	 NTP Server Misuse and Abuse
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTP_server_misuse_and_abuse)

   * 	 NIST Authenticated NTP Service
     (http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/auth-ntp.cfm)

   So, all you have to do is make certain the time on your GNU
remotecontrol server is set to the time you prefer. Then, save yourself
a lot of hassle and set the time on your devices every month by using
GNU remotecontrol. Finally, use GNU remotecontrol to change any IP
enabled thermostat during the Daylight Savings Time change. This will
make certain all of your thermostats are correct and have all of your
logged data match up properly when comparing by time.

7.3 admin.php
=============

7.3.1 Purpose
-------------

This web page provides User Management in the GNU remotecontrol
application.

7.3.2 Fields
------------



   * 	 *User Name* - The GNU remotecontrol user account.

   * 	 *Max # Therms* - The maximum number of thermostats allowed for
     that user account.

7.3.3 Usage
-----------

Add user accounts with the *exact same name* you setup the user
accounts in your Web Server. Edit and Delete user accounts from this
web page, as well. Security to access this web page is completely
handled by the Web Server and the Operating System running your Web
Server. You need to restrict access to this web page to only allow the
user accounts you want to be able to add/edit/delete the other user
accounts.

   We added a management option to this web page, per a request
received during our design of GNU remotecontrol. The demand for this
feature is the desire to increase awareness of the need to also setup
Remote Monitoring for a newly added thermostat. The intent of this
feature is to provide a check and balance for all roles that use GNU
remotecontrol. You set the total number of thermostats the user account
can have to whatever you prefer.

7.4 index.php
=============

7.4.1 Purpose
-------------

This web page provides the ability to manage your individual
thermostats, all at one time.

7.4.2 Fields
------------



   * 	 *Display Language* - This form control selects the language
     you choose to display your GNU remotecontrol session for your GNU
     remotecontrol user account. The language option you choose to
     display GNU remotecontrol is saved in your GNU remotecontrol user
     account profile in the GNU remotecontrol database. This setting is
     saved for you so you do not have to choose a language option each
     time you use GNU remotecontrol. Selecting another language option
     to display GNU remote control will update this setting of your GNU
     remotecontrol user account in the GNU remotecontrol database. This
     display information lives in the *language* table in the GNU
     remotecontrol database. You can edit this information to better
     suit your liking or add another language to the GNU remotecontrol
     database. Please see the section *Usage Recommendations* for
     instruction to achieve either of these options.

   * 	 *Device Name* - This object stores the device name of the
     thermostat. This object is controlled through the web interface on
     the General Settings web page of the thermostat.

   * 	 *Site Name* - This object stores the device location of the
     thermostat. This object is controlled through the web interface on
     the General Settings web page of the thermostat.

   * 	 *Model #* - This object stores the device model number. It is
     read-only, and resident in the thermostat device firmware.

   * 	 *Custom Name* - This field is unique to GNU remotecontrol and
     not on the device. We added this field to supplement the *Device
     Name* and *Site Name* fields on the device. The intent of this
     field is to increase capability when you use your Database
     Management to separate out thermostats for management purposes
     currently unforeseen. It is always nice to have more capability
     than necessary. An example of how to use this field is to enter
     GPS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gps) coordinates of where your
     thermostat is located or further define the *Site Name* field.

   * 	 *Description* - This field is unique to GNU remotecontrol and
     not on the device. We added this field to supplement the *Device
     Name* and *Site Name* fields on the device. The intent of this
     field is to increase capability when you use your Database
     Management to separate out thermostats for management purposes
     currently unforeseen. It is always nice to have more capability
     than necessary. An example of how to use this field is to enter
     GPS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gps) coordinates of where your
     thermostat is located or further define the *Site Name* field.

   * 	 *Domain Name/IP* - This field is unique to GNU remotecontrol.
     You must setup your network to access your thermostat inside
     and/or outside of your local network. This entry is the address
     necessary for your GNU remotecontrol server to get to your
     thermostat device. Enter into this field whatever that address is,
     whether it is a private IP address, a public IP address, or a
     Fully Qualified Domain Name (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fqdn)
     address, as concluded through your Domain Name System
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) resolution.

   * 	 *Port* - This is the port your thermostat is set to use for
     the address it has been assigned. Please see the field *Domain
     Name/IP* for understanding of how to populate this field. This
     object is controlled through the web interface on the Network
     Settings web page of the thermostat.

   * 	 *Time Zone Offset* - This is the Time Zone of where the
     thermostat is located. This information lives in the
     *timezoneoffset* table in the GNU remotecontrol database. You may
     want to use either the *Custom Name* or *Description* fields to
     record Time Zone as a reminder note to yourself. Also, you will
     most likely want to use Database Management to update this field
     in the GNU remotecontrol database when Daylight Savings Time
     occurs. Please read the section *Time* for more information on
     this recommendation.

   * 	 *Login * - This field contains the *admin* user account of the
     thermostat. Click *Set* after you have added the thermostat. You
     are prompted to enter and save the password for the admin user
     account of the thermostat. See the section *Adding a Thermostat*
     below for more detailed information.

7.4.3 Usage
-----------

You are ready to use index.php web page after you have setup the
admin.php user accounts. The detailed sections below address how to use
each capability.

   Loading index.php causes each attribute of each device to be read.
Please see the section *Adding a Thermostat* for more information. The
thermostats entered in your GNU remotecontrol database will populate
with the current values of the first device in the profile list upon
the initial load of index.php. Click the hyperlink _View Settings_ to
see the parameters currently set on the device. You only view the
settings of a single thermostat device, one at a time. This is listed
as _Currently Viewing_, after clicking the hyperlink _View Settings_.
Please see the section *View Settings* for more information.

   The data from a thermostat device is not loaded if the thermostat
device cannot be reached or if the thermostat device is unresponsive.
Remember, index.php does not populate the values for this thermostat
device if this thermostat device is first in your listing,

   A status indicator appears next to each selected thermostat device
when the submission is complete. This status indicator can render:
_Done_, _NoTrans_, or _Error_. A Tool Tip will appear with more
information when hovering over this status indicator.

   PHP errors are logged to your PHP logging, if you have this feature
enabled in your PHP configuration. A logging mechanism for errors
returned directly from a thermostat device writes that information to
the _errorlog_ table in the GNU remotecontrol database. This logging
will occur when the thermostat device is reachable and responsive, but
something goes awry with the submission, or if there is something wrong
with the device and the device returns an error.

   Day in and day out, you will want to know the settings on the
different IP enabled thermostats you are charged with caring for. Using
GNU remotecontrol will help you see if anyone has changed the settings
on an IP enabled thermostat, thereby altering and/or defeating your
energy management strategy. Combing into the equation a Remote
Monitoring Server with Email Server notification and you are on top of
the game for energy management.

   *Reload* index.php at any time you prefer to poll each device and
read the current parameters of the attributes for all device entries.

   See *Troubleshooting* for more information.

7.4.3.1 Adding a Thermostat
...........................

Highlighted fields are required.

   You must have the password to the *admin* user account for the
device you want GNU remotecontrol to write to. This is to ensure that
the user of GNU remotecontrol has administrative authority to the
device. Mandating usage of the admin user account further assures that
writing to the device occurs by a user with complete authority to that
device. Complete the highlighted fields, click *Add*, and click *Set*
to enter the admin user account password for that thermostat. You have
now completely added your first thermostat to GNU remotecontrol.

   Repeat the above paragraph for all remaining thermostats you wish to
add to GNU remotecontrol.

   *Reload* index.php at any time you prefer to poll each device and
read the current parameters of the attributes for all device entries.

   See *Troubleshooting* for more information.

7.4.3.2 View Settings
.....................

Click _View Settings_ to load the parameters of that specific
thermostat into the *HVAC Settings*, *Setback Scheduling*, and *Sensor
Settings*. _View Settings_ will toggle to display as *Currently
Viewing*. This capability allows you to easily see what each thermostat
is set to once you load index.php, versus having to go to each
individual thermostat to review this information. This is a *very*
powerful time and bandwidth saving capability.

   *Reload* index.php at any time you prefer to poll each device and
read the current parameters of the attributes for all device entries.

   See *Troubleshooting* for more information.

7.4.3.3 Write to a Thermostat - Date and Time
.............................................

Our research during the development of GNU remotecontrol found users
want 2 separate buttons to operate GNU remotecontrol. They want a
button to set the time on a thermostat and another button to set the
rest of the HVAC settings on the thermostat. Here are the steps when
using GNU remotecontrol for writing Date and Time to any device:


  1. 	 Select the device you want to write to by way of the check-box.

  2. 	 Click *Set Time on Selected Thermostats*.

   The Date and Time of the GNU remotecontrol server is displayed to
the right of this button. The time of the GNU remotecontrol server is
not necessarily the same time of the computer you are using. When you
click *Set Time on Selected Thermostats*, the following is achieved:


  1. 	 The exact current Date and Time of Greenwich Mean Time is
     captured in a memory variable.

  2. 	 The Date and Time for each selected thermostat is calculated
     in comparison to Greenwich Mean Time and the GMT offset stored in
     the profile of each thermostat.

  3. 	 Writing that calculated Date and Time to each selected
     thermostat device.

  4. 	 The Transaction Log is updated with the OLD and NEW Date and
     Time of each thermostat device.

   This capability enables you to then use transactionhistory.php
and/or Database Management to see if any thermostat device is gaining
or losing time, identifying if you need to investigate a particular
thermostat device. Please review the section above called *Time* for
more information as to why this functionality has been designed.

   *Reload* index.php at any time you prefer to poll each device and
read the current parameters of the attributes for all device entries.

   See *Troubleshooting* for more information.

7.4.3.4 Write to a Thermostat - HVAC Settings
.............................................

Our research during the development of GNU remotecontrol found users
want 2 separate buttons to operate GNU remotecontrol. They want a
button to set the time on a thermostat and another button to set the
rest of the HVAC settings on the thermostat. Here are the steps when
using GNU remotecontrol for writing HVAC Settings to any device:


  1. 	 Select the device you want to write to by way of the check-box.

  2. 	 Change the attributes and parameters as you prefer.

  3. 	 Click *Submit*.

   Once you click the *Submit* button, GNU remotecontrol goes to each
device, makes the changes, and populates the Transaction Log in the GNU
remotecontrol database. This capability enables you to then use
transactionhistory.php and/or Database Management to see if any
thermostat device is changing settings, identifying if you need to
investigate who is doing this or if the device is problematic. Finally,
index.php is refreshed and *only* the attributes that were changed are
reflected with their new values. The benefit of this automation is the
entire list of device attributes are not polled again. This is a very
powerful time and bandwidth saving capability.

   *Reload* index.php at any time you prefer to poll each device and
read the current parameters of the attributes for all device entries.

   See *Troubleshooting* for more information.

7.5 transactionhistory.php
==========================

7.5.1 Purpose
-------------

This web page provides the Transaction Log in the GNU remotecontrol
application. This web page is read-only, with search fields to quickly
and easily find what you are looking for.

7.5.2 Fields
------------



   * 	 *Thermostat* - The thermostat that was changed.

   * 	 *Field* - The device attribute that was changed.

   * 	 *Old Value* - The previous parameter of the attribute that was
     changed.

   * 	 *New Value* - The current parameter of the attribute that was
     changed.

   * 	 *Timestamp* - The Date/Time the device attribute was changed.

7.5.3 Usage
-----------

Enter search values in the respective fields to quickly filter and
display the rows you are looking for.

   The field headers of this web page are rendered in the display
language you choose, but the field data of this web page is not
translated into another display language. The field data is only
rendered in English. This is because the Proliphix thermostat device
only renders in English. This provides you confidence the information
you are looking at transactionhistory.php can be easily compared to the
information rendered in the web server of the Proliphix thermostat
device.

7.6 Troubleshooting
===================



   * 	 Go to your error log for your Web Server any time you find a
     problem where you are not receiving an error directly from GNU
     remotecontrol.

   * 	 Review the _errorlog_ table to read the information
     transmitted by the thermostat device to learn why the thermostat
     device failed to properly respond.

   * 	 If the IP enabled thermostat is not available because it is
     powered off or the data network that contains the IP enabled
     thermostat has problems, here is what is achieved:


       1. 		During load of index.php, as it reads the
          device (IP enabled thermostat) list from the grid at the top
          to go and get their current settings, should any device be
          unavailable, GNU remotecontrol will proceed on after a few
          seconds of no response to look for the next device instead of
          halting the process.

       2. 		Look to the status indicator next to each
          selected thermostat device when the submission is complete.
          This status indicator can render: _Done_, _NoTrans_, or
          _Error_. A Tool Tip will appear with more information when
          hovering over this status indicator.


8 Usage Recommendations
***********************

8.1 Start Small
===============

You can run GNU remotecontrol on a laptop, a desktop, even a hand-held
computer.....as long as you can achieve setting up your Web Server and
Database Server.

   It will probably be much easier on you to setup a GNU remotecontrol
system while using your existing Energy Management Control System. This
will allow you to learn, test, try, think, try some more, all
side-by-side with all of your existing systems. Then, when you are
ready, switch over seamlessly to use GNU remotecontrol as your primary
system, along with your (then) old Energy Management Control System, to
make sure you are absolutely comfortable with your setup of your GNU
remotecontrol system. Finally, once your are comfortable with your GNU
remotecontrol, decommission your old Energy Management Control System.

   Benefits of running GNU remotecontrol on a smaller hardware
combination include:


   * 	 Getting GNU remotecontrol up and running for a
     Proof-of-Concept.

   * 	 Managing the HVAC systems of different sites without having to
     be at each of those sites.

8.2 Strongly Encouraged
=======================



   * 	 Restrict your data network to only allow a few network
     addresses to connect to the IP enabled thermostats. This makes
     sure the IP enabled thermostat does not get overloaded from too
     many users trying to access it where it fails to respond, possibly
     requiring the IP enabled thermostat to be power cycled. Use,
     instead, the logged data of by minute and by quarter hour to run
     your monitoring and reporting. (Please continue reading for more
     information to accomplish this recommendation.)

   * 	 Setup your Remote Monitoring Server to log sensor readings
     every minute. Do this for 15 concurrent minutes. Delete previous
     records so you only have the 15 readings in this record set at any
     given time. Then, you have a granular recording of data in
     combination with your Remote Monitoring Server recording the same
     information in 15-minute intervals. It takes about a minute for a
     change to register on a sensor, shy of an extreme combination of
     circumstances. This sensor reading approach provides you with all
     of the monitoring and reporting data you could ever hope for.

   * 	 Script setting the time on your IP enabled thermostats.
     Recommend setting the time every month, at a minimum. Clocks of
     all kinds are always gaining or losing a few seconds here and
     there, to the point that it adds up to a few minutes here and
     there. Setting the time on a regular monthly basis avoids the
     whole gaining and losing problem.

   * 	 Roaming Brown Outs
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_%28electricity%29) and
     Natural Disasters in the vicinity of your thermostat devices cause
     for your thermostat devices to have all kinds of power supply
     problems. Your thermostat device may very well  have a weak
     on-board battery. That means the Date and Time on your thermostat
     has a poor chance of being correct and any Setback Scheduling on
     the device has little to no chance of being properly executed. Set
     the Date and Time every hour on your thermostat device, at the
     very minimum. The fact that a Natural Disaster has occurred means
     your energy management strategy will most likely not be able to
     occur, anyway. Plan some type of HVAC Settings for dealing with a
     Natural Disaster. Perhaps a plan for the Winter months and a plan
     for the Summer months. Perhaps turning on the fan for Architecture
     Ventilation
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_%28architecture%29) is
     the best course of action, promoting health and safety in the
     facility. Perhaps activating heating or cooling is also in the
     best course of action. Use scripting to help you meet this need.

   * 	 Use Database Management to change the Time Zone field in the
     thermostat profile when Daylight Savings Time occurs. For example,
     Database Management will convert North America Eastern Standard
     Time, with a GMT offset of -5, to North America Eastern Daylight
     Time, with a GMT offset of -4. Remember, there is Australian
     Eastern Time and North American Eastern Time, each with Daylight
     and Standard options. Clearly, Database management will help you
     keep all of your settings correct in your GNU remotecontrol
     database. Using Database Management will also save you the time
     and effort of using index.php to manually change each thermostat
     you have setup in GNU remotecontrol. Set it up as a SQL script to
     change the Time Zone entry in the thermostat profile. Run the
     script when Daylight Savings Time occurs.

   * 	 Script setting your heating/cooling/ventilation levels as a
     comparison of outdoors conditions. Say so many degrees difference
     between outside and inside, same for a difference in percentage of
     relative humidity.

   * 	 Use the Remote Monitoring of your location to change a website
     appearance
     (http://css-tricks.com/using-weather-data-to-change-your-websites-apperance-through-php-and-css/).

   * 	 Use the Remote Monitoring of your location to build Software
     Widgets (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget) and/or Web
     Widgets (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget).

   * 	 Setup a simple web page that will fit the temperature and
     humidity readings of both the thermostats and the weather
     conditions you care about onto the screen of your cell phone
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbrowser). You then can easily
     see, in a single viewing
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web), what you care to know.

   * 	 Editing of a Display Language in GNU remotecontrol mandates
     editing the contents of the _language_ table and the _resource_
     table in the GNU remotecontrol database. Edit these tables with
     the entries you prefer. Reload index.php in your browser. The
     changes you made to the _language_ table and the _resource_ table
     in the GNU remotecontrol database are then displayed in all GNU
     remotecontrol user account sessions of GNU remotecontrol.

   * 	 Adding a Display Language to the GNU remotecontrol database
     mandates adding data to the _language_ table and the _resource_
     table in the GNU remotecontrol database. Add the new fields and
     data with the entries you prefer. Reload index.php in your
     browser. The changes you made to the _language_ table and the
     _resource_ table in the GNU remotecontrol database are then
     displayed in all GNU remotecontrol user account sessions of GNU
     remotecontrol.

8.3 Food for Thought
====================

There are many different ways you can use the data you collect:


   * 	 Really Simple Syndication (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss)
     (RSS)

   * 	 Atom (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29)

   * 	 Web Service (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)

   * 	 Software Widget (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget)

   * 	 Web Widget (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget)

9 Use Case Scenarios
********************

The following are very real examples, with abstract names, to
illustrate how to put all of this technology together so it will work
for you.

9.1 Scenario 1 - Building Maintenance
=====================================

This person is overworked and underpaid at the *ABC Corporation*. They
have a boss that all the time wants to know if "thus and so" got done.
This person needs a way to get things done faster and have automated
documentation that it is complete.

   This person uses GNU remotecontrol to help with setting the HVAC in
this company, and does a screen shot of the Transaction Log for their
boss to see, as their boss wants an email to see what happens.

9.2 Scenario 2 - Office Worker
==============================

This person is overworked and underpaid at *Super-Duper Insurance
Company*. They haves a boss that all the time wants to know if "thus
and so" got done. They need a way to get things done faster and have
automated documentation that it is complete.

   They use GNU remotecontrol to help with setting the HVAC in this
company, and does a screen shot of the Transaction Log for their boss
to see, as their boss wants an email to see what happens.

9.3 Scenario 3 - Property Manager
=================================

This person is overworked and underpaid at *Manage 4 You Property
Management Corporation*. They have a boss that all the time wants to
know if "thus and so" got done. This person needs a way to get things
done faster and have automated documentation that it is complete.

   This person uses GNU remotecontrol to help with setting the HVAC in
the properties to achieve considerable savings on energy cost, and does
a screen shot of the Transaction Log for their boss to see, as their
boss wants an email to see what happens.

9.4 Scenario 4 - Restaurant Operations
======================================

This person is doing pretty well in life. This person owns several
restaurants around town called *Super Good Eats*. Each site has 2
different HVAC units. This person also setup an IP thermostat in their
house. Later, they needed to care for their elderly mother, so they put
an IP thermostat in the house of their mother. When this person sets
the IP thermostat in their house, they set the house of their mother
the same way. This way, this person knows pretty well how things are in
the house of their mother, even though they are not there with their
mother.

   The corporate office is all of the time messing with the IP
thermostat and there is a lot of inner-office politics from this
problem. This person wanted that problem to go away, and to quit paying
through the nose in electric bill to keep the air conditioning going.
This person set's the corporate office the same as their home, so they
know the climate in the office pretty is much the same as the climate
in their home. The owner can now can shut down arguments often before
they occur.

   This person is saving so much money on energy costs they were able
to buy a cabin in the mountains for when they and their family want to
get away from the ocean front, where they live. This person remotely
sets the temperature before they arrive at their cabin. The owner also
makes sure that the temperature and humidity in their cabin is not too
extreme when they are away, so pipes don't burst, and that there is not
a mold/mildew problem.

9.5 Scenario 5 - Certified Energy Manager
=========================================

The Certified Energy Manager (CEM) needs to manage multiple sites for
multiple customers. The CEM needs to log data over a long time period.
The CEM needs to adjust set-points on different HVAC equipment to work
out the specific energy control measures for each customer. The CEM has
multiple Direct Digital Control
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Digital_Control) (DDC) points. The
CEM needs to know a great deal of information from these DDC points.
The CEM could very much benefit from having all of this information
coming to them in a structured manner, all stored in a database,
leveraging their already existing Information Technology to access and
manage this collection of resources.

   The CEM can setup GNU remotecontrol over different computers. The
Web Server, Database Server, Email Server, and Remote Monitoring Server
are all separate from the CEM laptop. The CEM is free to travel and
access GNU remotecontrol as necessary to adjust set-points, while
receiving notifications that something needs attention. The CEM is not
bound to their office all day long.

9.6 Scenario 6 - Industrial Manufacturing Facility
==================================================

This site has many different air-handling units, many different
dampers, and several sources of heat. The facility has adequate staff
to handle on-site maintenance. See the section above regarding the
Certified Energy Manger to learn more about the aspect of accessing and
managing Direct Digital Control (DDC) points.

   The benefit here is using GNU remotecontrol to decrease reaction
time when Remote Monitoring finds a temperature or humidity threshold
is close to being reached and not interrupt manufacturing operations.

9.7 Scenario 7 - Facility Manager
=================================

This scenario is a refinement of the Industrial Manufacturing Facility
illustration, but wider in scope than only manufacturing.

   The Facility Manager often does not have a Certified Energy Manger
to work with them. See the section above regarding the Certified Energy
Manger to learn more about the aspect of accessing and managing Direct
Digital Control (DDC) points.

   This site has many different air-handling units, many different
dampers, and several sources of heat. The facility has adequate staff
to handle on-site maintenance. The benefit here is using GNU
remotecontrol to decrease reaction time when Remote Monitoring finds a
temperature or humidity threshold is close to being reached and not
interrupt facility operations.

   Examples of their daily maintenance routine includes:



   * 	Cleaning thermostats and sensors after they get a build up of
     dust, oil, or other pollutants on them, defeating their ability to
     operate well or at all.

   * 	Assist with device calibrating efforts, as a hand-held
     thermostat and a networked sensor showing the same reading is
     always preferred.

   * 	Justifying HVAC upgrades, as appropriate, to different areas of
     the facility. Examples of this include a fan, a compressor, a
     coil, or changing from constant air volume to a variable air
     volume terminal unit.

   * 	Managing workers to achieve these tasks.

   There are loads of reasons to implement automation in this facility.
Mostly, to help the staff accomplish their work in a timely manner, and
assure they have a way to schedule vacation time for the staff.

9.8 Scenario 8 - External Information
=====================================

See the *Cautionary* paragraph in the *Power over Ethernet* section. It
is necessary to understand about powering a thermostat for this
scenario to make sense. There are countless ways to bring external
information sensors into your IP enabled thermostat and use your Remote
Monitoring Server to get that data to you.

9.9 Scenario 9 - Financial Manager
==================================

The Financial Manager is the person that has spending authority over
the facility. Month after month, they have high electric and fuel bills
because their facility is running either too hot or too cold due to an
inability to effectively operate the HVAC systems. They do not have
separate meters to know what part of the facility is using however much
electricity or fuel. They simply have to do something, as they cannot
justify these high expense every month. They lead a Cost Benefit
Analysis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis)
for their facility, leveraging the staff that works at the facility, a
Certified Energy Manager, off-site staff, and anyone else they need to
complete their Cost Benefit Analysis. The end result is to know if GNU
remotecontrol will help them lower their electric and fuel bills. Most
likely, it will.

9.10 Scenario 10 - Automated Meter Reading
==========================================

Automated Meter Reading
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_meter_reading) is not the same
as Smart Metering (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter). They are
both part of Advanced Metering Infrastructure
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter#Advanced_metering_infrastructure).
Smart Metering has much more capability than Automated Meter Reading.
Suffice it to say, if you are going to implement either of these
technologies, it only makes sense to be able to do something with all
of that data. Responding by changing your HVAC system, as appropriate,
very much helps to increase the effectiveness of you energy management
strategy. Connect your Remote Monitoring Server to the data coming in
from your Automated Meter Reading or Smart Metering so you can compare
that data to the rest of the data you are capturing. You will have a
very clear picture of how much energy you are using to achieve your
energy management strategy.

9.11 Scenario 11 - Smart Metering
=================================

Smart Metering (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter) is not the
same as Automated Meter Reading
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_meter_reading). They are both
part of Advanced Metering Infrastructure
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter#Advanced_metering_infrastructure).
Smart Metering has much more capability than Automated Meter Reading.

very clear picture of how much energy you are using to achieve your
energy management strategy.

9.12 Scenario 12 - Utility Providers
====================================

This provider has decided to offer an energy management service to
their customer. They have thousands and thousands of customers. They
need a way to help their customer manage their thermostat for
generating heating and cooling, but also maintain air flow in their
residential and commercial facilities. This provider also needs to
improve their ability to monitor energy consumption, plan for energy
manufacturing, and manage emergencies such as roaming Brownouts
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_%28electricity%29) caused by
storms and other catastrophic events. Please see the section *Usage
Recommendations* for more information.

   Turning off all power to the HVAC system as a whole removes the
ability of the HVAC fan to circulate air and maintain air flow. This
defeats the energy management strategy, as circulating some amount of
air necessary for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most importantly,
Environmental Health and Safety
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Health_and_Safety) has
different ventilation requirements for residential, commercial, and
industrial facilities.

   This provider has a 2 part offering to their customers. Part 1, the
provider uses GNU remotecontrol to do more than just turn off the
electricity, water, and/or fuel to the HVAC unit. They are now capable
of providing either heating or cooling adjustments while having the
HVAC fan circulate air, or only circulate air without a heating or
cooling adjustment. This combination of options now available are much
more than turning off the entire HVAC unit. Part 2, the provider also
uses Smart Metering to connect HVAC usage with energy meter readings to
log readings on an hourly basis. This combined offering provides for
better control and usage of energy resources, HVAC resources, and
visibility to understand customer energy usage. Energy usage as the
billing cycle progresses and historically, of course. Imagine how happy
the customer will be to be able to see that granular level of detailed
billing.

9.13 Summary
============

There is no single reason to implement GNU remotecontrol. The reasoning
is often multiple and overlapping. All of these reasons help to
decrease your costs and increase your comfort level. Think locally and
globally, and you will easily see there is more good reason to use GNU
remotecontrol than ever considered before.

10 Implementation Cost
**********************

The GNU remotecontrol framework leverages already existing Information
Technologies of a Data Network, Web Server with a complete Operating
System, Database Server, Remote Monitoring Server, and Email Server.
The cost to implement GNU remotecontrol is then reduced to the
following ordered list:

  1. Labor to obtain and prepare GNU remotecontrol.

  2. Labor to configure your already existing Information Technologies.

  3. Purchase cabling to run from your data network to your IP enabled
     thermostat.

  4. Labor to install cabling from your data network to your IP enabled
     thermostat.

  5. Purchase IP enabled thermostat.

  6. Purchase a power supply for IP enabled thermostat.

  7. Labor to install IP enabled thermostat.

  8. Labor to install power supply for IP enabled thermostat.

  9. Labor to configure IP enabled thermostat.

     Note:: It is highly recommended you choose external sensors for
     your IP enabled thermostat having pre-wired cabling long enough to
     reach where you need the external sensor to reside. Adding in more
     cable between a device and an external sensor is often
     problematic. Mixing different cable types, in either quality of
     cable or type of cable.....or both.....very often result with
     problems to having accurate sensor readings. This pre-wired
     cabling, per manufacturer design and intent of their sensor,
     decreases the likelihood of the sensor resulting with skewed
     metrics. Most external sensors are extremely touchy. This is a
     good thing, as it provides you with accurate metrics. However,
     proper cable selection of an external sensor is paramount to
     proper metrics. Go with the option of a manufacturer having enough
     cable as-built to meet your needs and not splicing on additional
     cable. Finally, consider the benefit of connecting your external
     sensor directly to your IP enabled thermostat, provided the IP
     enabled thermostat can accept it. The benefit of sensor averaging
     is highly valuable to improving system performance. A direct
     connection to the IP enabled thermostat also eliminates the need
     for another power supply to operate the external sensor.

   The cost to implement GNU remotecontrol, in comparison with a lesser
energy management strategy for any HVAC system, justifies the
completion of a Cost Benefit Analysis
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) to
determine if GNU remotecontrol is appropriate for your circumstances.
Most likely, it is.

11 Roadmap
**********

The GNU remotecontrol Road Map is planned for and limited by the
following boundaries.

11.1 Interoperability
=====================

The Future of GNU remotecontrol is a commitment to International
standards and protocols for Information Technology to provide
availability, relevance, transparency, and maintenance of the GNU
remotecontrol framework. The BACnet XML Working Group is an excellent
example of these attributes. For more information, *Note GNU
remotecontrol & BACnet::.

11.2 HVAC Original Equipment Manufacturer - Feature Addition
============================================================

OEM's have not added the feature of IP enablement in the past. The
benefits for OEM's to add IP enablement to their thermostat product
offering far outweigh any hindrance from remaining a standalone device.
Examples of these benefits include interoperability, furthered energy
management strategies, and increased customer satisfaction from the new
capability of remote access to their thermostat.

11.3 HVAC Aftermarket Equipment Manufacturer - Feature Addition
===============================================================

AEM's have added the feature of IP enablement in the past with limited
success. This is mostly due to the dependency on another piece of
proprietary technology to handle translation of some proprietary
technology to the data network for the thermostat. The proprietary
aspect of the technology will often bottleneck the success of that
technology. The success of the thermostat as a complimentary good is
well proven. There are hundreds of different programmable thermostats
for sale at both the local home supply stores and globally. Proper
selection of any aftermarket product or service is critical to the
success of the primary product being supplemented. A simple example of
this is selecting the different parts to enhance an engine for an
automobile, or a boat, or a snow mobile, et cetera. Aftermarket
Equipment Manufacturers must demonstrate they have in their offering
the capability to not damage the existing primary product.
Specifically, a heating and cooling system. There must also be solid
proof their offering enhances system performance by adding additional
feature/benefit combinations. Finally, their offering must be
constructed to meet manufacturing directives, such as RoHS
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROHS).

11.4 Cost Benefit Analysis
==========================

The outcome of your Cost Benefit Analysis
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis)  will help
you see your Return on Investment
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return) (ROI). This will most
likely be the bottom line to the success of GNU remotecontrol for you.
The Retro Commission (http://sccmet.com/whatis.html) (RCx) of any
facility, small or large, is best evaluated by.....*is it worth it*?
Even Testing-Adjusting-Balancing
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_Adjusting_Balancing) a system is
well worth the time and effort, to make sure your system is setup as
suitable for your needs and wants. The answer to this ROI question
mandates completing several different calculations to make that
determination. New construction does not require as many calculations
to come to that determination, but often mandates different aspects to
be evaluated and then calculated. Don't forget to add in the
cost/saving of Information Technology. This list includes system
design, capital expenditures, and system operation. Then, don't forget
to add in your End User cost/saving for training and system operation.

   Not every facility must have a complete set of calculations to know
what you need to do for your energy management strategy. Consider
simple advice on best practices offered by your *qualifed* Decision
Makers to help you select what is best for you. Regardless of what you
choose for your energy management strategy, have a plan.....work the
plan.....review and revise your plan, as appropriate.

   The cost to implement GNU remotecontrol, in comparison with a lesser
energy management strategy for any HVAC system, justifies the
completion of a Cost Benefit Analysis
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) to
determine if GNU remotecontrol is appropriate for your circumstances.
Most likely, it is.

12 REFERENCE
************

12.1 Cabling 101
================

12.1.1 Introduction
-------------------

The intent of this writing is *not* to make you an expert in cabling.
The intent is to provide you with the necessary reference information,
tips, and recommendations for you to wisely use cabling. There is no,
repeat.....no substitute for hands on experience with cabling.

   Please carefully read all of this information before you attempt
your cabling efforts. Experience is a great teacher, so don't be afraid
or discouraged if you mix up wiring patterns or do not terminate a
connection well enough through the proper amount of pressure on a wire
connector in the beginning of your cabling efforts.

12.1.2 Cable
------------

Category 5 cable (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable) is
available in many forms. The cable is solid core 24-AWG
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge). 8 separately
jacketed wires, twisted in pairs, making 4 pairs all contained within a
protective jacket. The jacket that wraps around that cable is either
Plenum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenum_cable) or Non-Plenum.
Plenum cable is rated for a fire hazard area. Category 5 cabling is
often rated as low-voltage (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_voltage),
meaning you do not need a license to install the cable. Please contact
your local fire authority for more information.

12.1.3 Grounding
----------------

Proper cable grounding is essential for safety. The assumption that the
cable carries a low amount of voltage is true, but it also carries
enough capability to damage the equipment connected together via your
cable and you.....the cabling person. The differences between
surge-suppression (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_suppression) and
transient-voltage-suppression
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient-voltage-suppression_diode)
cannot be stated enough. Please contact your local fire authority for
more information.

12.1.4 Installation
-------------------

Category 5 cable is installed in either electrical conduit
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conduit), cable trays
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tray), or J-Hooks
(https://www.google.com/search?q=j-hooks). Cable must, must, must be
properly supported to prevent stretching the copper wire and cause for
minor breaks in the wire. Minor wire breaks cause for performance
issues in quality-of-service
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service), and lead to a
breakage in one or more wires. Cable is laid out in a pattern of either
a main distribution frame
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_distribution_frame) or an
intermediate distribution frame
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_distribution_frame).

12.1.5 Termination
------------------

Properly installed cable is then connected with some type of registered
jack/plug (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack). This end
result is called a cable termination or a wire termination.

12.1.6 Testing
--------------

All cabling must have continuity
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_test) all of the time. A
simple cable tester (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tester) is
probably the most manageable continuity tester
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_tester) there is after cable
has been terminated with a registered jack/plug to determine if you
have continuity. If you have nothing else to test with, connecting 2
bare wires together with a wire nut
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_nut) on one end, then testing the
other ends with a multi-meter (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter)
is always an option. This is quite valuable after cable has been laid
in place and you want to know if it has continuity before terminating
the cable.

12.1.7 Usage Notes
------------------




   * 	You have the probability of good quality-of-service
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service) after cable is
     properly installed, but it is not guaranteed. Wise planning of
     your installation is paramount to not having problems related to
     cabling.

   * 	Most cable installations go through some type of usage change
     during the lifecycle of the cable. Today, imagine you have 1
     device connecting to 1 port on your data network switch. Tomorrow,
     you may need more devices to connect to the same port on that same
     data network switch. That means you need to put another data
     network switch into the picture. Where that additional data
     network switch will reside is the unknown. Moving more data across
     that same cable means the quality of that cable, and the quality
     of installing that cable, really does matter. Sure, you can always
     pull more cable. However, you still need more ports on a data
     network switch that lives somewhere to connect those additional
     devices. Wise choices for cable installation provides more options
     to choose from, options that can easily increase cost
     effectiveness for owning and operating your equipment.

   * 	Your continuity tester will help you see when you have the
     proper wiring pattern and the proper amount of pressure on a wire
     termination.

   * 	A majority of the cables manufacturers post a required a
     minimum bend radius for their cable of, "_four times the
     diameter_" to avoid problems. A cable loop that is too small
     results in nothing more than broken cable. Minor wire breaks cause
     for performance issues in quality-of-service. It is not worth
     installing lesser quality cable that will cause you problems, nor
     is it worth installing good cable in a way that will cause you
     problems. Plan your installation and you will have years of
     satisfaction from your cable.

   * 	Pull some extra cable, loop it in a circle, and wire tie the
     cable loop together. That provides for moving terminated cable a
     bit if necessary, and provides extra cable should you mix up
     things when you terminate the cable and need to correct the
     termination.

   * 	The satisfaction from installing your own cable is great,
     indeed. The cost of installing your own cable is sometimes best
     paid for through a cabling company. Count the cost and choose
     either your own labor or labor from a cabling company that best
     suits you requirements.

   * 	Remember, quality-of-service
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service) is only possible
     after cable is properly installed.

12.1.8 Cautionary
-----------------

Whatever you do, always install your cable as required by your fire
authority and always, always, always properly support your cable with
either electrical conduit, cable trays, or J-Hooks. Suffice it to say,
cable that is not properly supported will eventually have small cracks
in the wire, resulting in a quality-of-service
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service) loss, progressing to
intermittent continuity problems, and ultimately completely break the
wire somewhere within the cable jacket.

12.2 Power over Ethernet (PoE) 101
==================================

12.2.1 Introduction
-------------------

Power over Ethernet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet)
is quite possibly the best thing to come along to the Information
Technology world of hardware since the 1980's. Literally, it is that
wonderful!  The essence of PoE is you can use cable that is rated as
low-voltage (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_voltage) to power a
multitude of PoE hardware devices
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Uses). The list of
what is capable of PoE is constantly growing. Here are some common PoE
terms to understand.

12.2.2 Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)
-------------------------------------

The PSE
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Power_sourcing_equipment)
is the network PoE element that inserts power onto a Category 5 cable.
It may be an endspan device, such as a PoE-enabled data network switch,
or a midspan device located between the data network switch and the
Powered Device (PD).

12.2.3 Powered Device (PD)
--------------------------

A PD (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Powered_device)
is the PoE capable device that receives power over Category 5 cable. It
could be a PoE-enabled IP telephone, a Wireless Access Point, an IP
enabled HVAC thermostat, any other IP device that needs electrical
power.

12.2.4 Midspan
--------------

A midspan device is a PSE that inserts power onto the Category 5 cable.
It is situated between the data network switch and the PD. Typically,
midspan devices are added to existing networks to allow the use of
PoE-enabled PD's.

12.2.5 Endspan
--------------

An endspan device is typically a data network switch that incorporates
PoE capabilities. Endspan devices often are implemented when a new
network is created, to avoid adding both midspan devices and a data
network switch.

12.2.6 Usage Notes
------------------

Now, should you need/want to move a device such as a Wireless Access
Point, an IP telephone, or an HVAC sensor to another location.....image
how nice it would be to not have to juggle the powering of that device.
There are many combination
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Powering_devices)
options available for PoE capable hardware.

   Pressing onward, imagine a device is locked up and you need to power
the device off and then turn it back on. Walking to that device could
very well be a hassle, and could require opening a lot of access
panels. Using PoE, you can turn off the power over your data network
and then turn it back on.

   The thing for you with PoE is you need to determine how much
electrical power you need. That will tell you what specification you
need to comply with. The manufacturer of the PoE device will tell you
what standards they are compatible with. From there, buy the PoE
supply. Your selection is either a simple single-port power injector
(Midspan), or a rack-mounted
(http://www2.microsemi.com/PowerDsine/Products/Midspan/) midspan power
injector, or buy new data network switches that have PoE built-in as an
integrated feature (Endspan). Count the cost and choose as best suits
you.

   The biggest benefit of PoE is you have the ability to have a better
handle on your surge-suppression
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_suppression) and
transient-voltage-suppression
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient-voltage-suppression_diode)
efforts. This is because you so chose to install your cabling as
recommended. Running a wire as an extension off of an HVAC unit, or a
wall outlet, to supply electricity to power the PoE capable hardware,
without also providing proper protection for that PoE hardware, is
absolutely and positively nothing but trouble. That trouble often shows
up as electrical damage in the form of peculiar performance of the
hardware, or even hardware failure.

12.2.7 Cautionary
-----------------

Here is a strong and very simple example of why powering your IP
enabled thermostat from an HVAC unit is a bad idea. The drain line on
the HVAC unit somehow gets blocked. This triggers the float switch to
prevent flooding and that powers down the whole system. The thermostat
has then been turned off due to the absence of power to the thermostat.
The same is true if you power your IP enabled thermostat from your HVAC
and not PoE. *That means you will be unable to access your IP enabled
thermostat from your data network*.

     Note:: You can also hook your float switch to your IP enabled
     thermostat, as an external information sensor, and know when that
     float switch is activated via Remote Monitoring. Power over
     Ethernet is a really good idea.

   Whatever you do, always use cable safely. Please contact your local
fire authority for more information.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
