<a name="Cabling-101"></a>
<h3 class="section">12.1 Cabling 101</h3>
<a name="Introduction-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>The intent of this writing is <strong>not</strong> to make you an expert in cabling. The intent is to provide you with the necessary reference information, tips, and recommendations for you to wisely use cabling. There is no, repeat.....no substitute for hands on experience with cabling.
</p>
<p>Please carefully read all of this information before you attempt your cabling efforts. Experience is a great teacher, so don&rsquo;t be afraid or discouraged if you mix up wiring patterns or do not terminate a connection well enough through the proper amount of pressure on a wire connector in the beginning of your cabling efforts.
</p>
<a name="Cable"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.2 Cable</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable">Category 5 cable</a> is available in many forms. The cable is solid core 24-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge">AWG</a>. 8 separately jacketed wires, twisted in pairs, making 4 pairs all contained within a protective jacket. The jacket that wraps around that cable is either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenum_cable">Plenum</a> or Non-Plenum. Plenum cable is rated for a fire hazard area. Category 5 cabling is often rated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_voltage">low-voltage</a>, meaning you do not need a license to install the cable. Please contact your local fire authority for more information. 
</p>
<a name="Grounding"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.3 Grounding</h4>
<p>Proper cable grounding is essential for safety. The assumption that the cable carries a low amount of voltage is true, but it also carries enough capability to damage the equipment connected together via your cable and you.....the cabling person. The differences between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_suppression">surge-suppression</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient-voltage-suppression_diode">transient-voltage-suppression</a> cannot be stated enough. Please contact your local fire authority for more information.
</p>
<a name="Installation"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.4 Installation</h4>
<p>Category 5 cable is installed in either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conduit">electrical conduit</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tray">cable trays</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=j-hooks">J-Hooks</a>. Cable must, must, must be properly supported to prevent stretching the copper wire and cause for minor breaks in the wire. Minor wire breaks cause for performance issues in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality-of-service</a>, and lead to a breakage in one or more wires. Cable is laid out in a pattern of either a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_distribution_frame">main distribution frame</a> or an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_distribution_frame">intermediate distribution frame</a>.
</p>
<a name="Termination"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.5 Termination</h4>
<p>Properly installed cable is then connected with some type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack">registered jack/plug</a>. This end result is called a cable termination or a wire termination.
</p>
<a name="Testing"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.6 Testing</h4>
<p>All cabling must have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_test">continuity</a> all of the time. A simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tester">cable tester</a> is probably the most manageable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_tester">continuity tester</a> there is after cable has been terminated with a registered jack/plug to determine if you have continuity. If you have nothing else to test with, connecting 2 bare wires together with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_nut">wire nut</a> on one end, then testing the other ends with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter">multi-meter</a> is always an option. This is quite valuable after cable has been laid in place and you want to know if it has continuity before terminating the cable.
</p>
<a name="Usage-Notes"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.7 Usage Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li> You have the probability of good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality-of-service</a> after cable is properly installed, but it is not guaranteed. Wise planning of your installation is paramount to not having problems related to cabling.
	</li><li> Most cable installations go through some type of usage change during the lifecycle of the cable. Today, imagine you have 1 device connecting to 1 port on your data network switch. Tomorrow, you may need more devices to connect to the same port on that same data network switch. That means you need to put another data network switch into the picture. Where that additional data network switch will reside is the unknown. Moving more data across that same cable means the quality of that cable, and the quality of installing that cable, really does matter. Sure, you can always pull more cable. However, you still need more ports on a data network switch that lives somewhere to connect those additional devices. Wise choices for cable installation provides more options to choose from, options that can easily increase cost effectiveness for owning and operating your equipment.
	</li><li> Your continuity tester will help you see when you have the proper wiring pattern and the proper amount of pressure on a wire termination.
	</li><li> A majority of the cables manufacturers post a required a minimum bend radius for their cable of, &quot;<em>four times the diameter</em>&quot; to avoid problems. A cable loop that is too small results in nothing more than broken cable. Minor wire breaks cause for performance issues in quality-of-service. It is not worth installing lesser quality cable that will cause you problems, nor is it worth installing good cable in a way that will cause you problems. Plan your installation and you will have years of satisfaction from your cable.
	</li><li> Pull some extra cable, loop it in a circle, and wire tie the cable loop together. That provides for moving terminated cable a bit if necessary, and provides extra cable should you mix up things when you terminate the cable and need to correct the termination.
	</li><li> The satisfaction from installing your own cable is great, indeed. The cost of installing your own cable is sometimes best paid for through a cabling company. Count the cost and choose either your own labor or labor from a cabling company that best suits you requirements.
	</li><li> Remember, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality-of-service</a> is only possible after cable is properly installed.
	</li></ul>

<a name="Cautionary"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.8 Cautionary</h4>
<p>Whatever you do, always install your cable as required by your fire authority and always, always, always properly support your cable with either electrical conduit, cable trays, or J-Hooks. Suffice it to say, cable that is not properly supported will eventually have small cracks in the wire, resulting in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality-of-service</a> loss, progressing to intermittent continuity problems, and ultimately completely break the wire somewhere within the cable jacket.

<h3 class="section">12.2 Power over Ethernet (PoE) 101</h3>
<a name="Introduction-2"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.1 Introduction</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">Power over Ethernet</a> is quite possibly the best thing to come along to the Information Technology world of hardware since the 1980&rsquo;s. Literally, it is that wonderful! The essence of PoE is you can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable">cable</a> that is rated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_voltage">low-voltage</a> to power a multitude of PoE hardware <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Uses">devices</a>. The list of what is capable of PoE is constantly growing. Here are some common PoE terms to understand.
</p>
<a name="Power-Sourcing-Equipment-_0028PSE_0029"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.2 Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Power_sourcing_equipment">PSE</a> is the network PoE element that inserts power onto a Category 5 cable. It may be an endspan device, such as a PoE-enabled data network switch, or a midspan device located between the data network switch and the Powered Device (PD).
</p>
<a name="Powered-Device-_0028PD_0029"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.3 Powered Device (PD)</h4>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Powered_device">PD</a> is the PoE capable device that receives power over Category 5 cable. It could be a PoE-enabled IP telephone, a Wireless Access Point, an IP enabled HVAC thermostat, any other IP device that needs electrical power.
</p>
<a name="Midspan"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.4 Midspan</h4>
<p>A midspan device is a PSE that inserts power onto the Category 5 cable. It is situated between the data network switch and the PD. Typically, midspan devices are added to existing networks to allow the use of PoE-enabled PD&rsquo;s.
</p>
<a name="Endspan"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.5 Endspan</h4>
<p>An endspan device is typically a data network switch that incorporates PoE capabilities. Endspan devices often are implemented when a new network is created, to avoid adding both midspan devices and a data network switch.
</p>
<a name="Usage-Notes-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.6 Usage Notes</h4>
<p>Now, should you need/want to move a device such as a Wireless Access Point, an IP telephone, or an HVAC sensor to another location.....imagine how nice it would be to not have to juggle the powering of that device. There are many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Powering_devices">combination</a> options available for PoE capable hardware.
</p>
<p>Pressing onward, imagine a device is locked up and you need to power the device off and then turn it back on. Walking to that device could very well be a hassle, and could require opening a lot of access panels. Using PoE, you can turn off the power over your data network and then turn it back on.
</p>
<p>The thing for you with PoE is you need to determine how much electrical power you need. That will tell you what specification you need to comply with. The manufacturer of the PoE device will tell you what standards they are compatible with. From there, buy the PoE supply. Your selection is either a simple single-port power injector (Midspan), or a <a href="http://www.microsemi.com/products/powerdsine">rack-mounted</a> midspan power injector, or buy new data network switches that have PoE built-in as an integrated feature (Endspan). Count the cost and choose as best suits you.
</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of PoE is you have the ability to have a better handle on your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_suppression">surge-suppression</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient-voltage-suppression_diode">transient-voltage-suppression</a> efforts. This is because you so chose to install your cabling as recommended. Running a wire as an extension off of an HVAC unit, or a wall outlet, to supply electricity to power the PoE capable hardware, without also providing proper protection for that PoE hardware, is absolutely and positively nothing but trouble. That trouble often shows up as electrical damage in the form of peculiar performance of the hardware, or even hardware failure.
</p>
<a name="Cautionary-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.7 Cautionary</h4>
<p>Here is a strong and very simple example of why powering your IP enabled thermostat from an HVAC unit is a bad idea.
</p>
<p>The drain line on the HVAC unit somehow gets blocked. This triggers the float switch to prevent flooding and that powers down the whole system. The thermostat has then been turned off due to the absence of power to the thermostat. The same is true if you power your IP enabled thermostat from your HVAC and not PoE. <strong>That means you will be unable to access your IP enabled thermostat from your data network</strong>.
</p>
<p>You can also hook your float switch to your IP enabled thermostat, as an external information sensor, and know when that float switch is activated via Remote Monitoring. Power over Ethernet is a really.....really.....good idea.
</p>
<p>Whatever you do, always use cable safely. Please contact your local fire authority for more information.
