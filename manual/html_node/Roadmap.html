<h2 class="chapter">11 Roadmap</h2>

<p>The GNU remotecontrol Road Map is planned for and limited by the following boundaries.

<h3 class="section">11.1 Interoperability</h3>

<p>The Future of GNU remotecontrol is a commitment to International standards and protocols for Information Technology to provide availability, relevance, transparency, and maintenance of the GNU remotecontrol framework. The BACnet XML Working Group is an excellent example of these attributes. For more information, See <a href="GNU-remotecontrol-_0026-BACnet.html#GNU-remotecontrol-_0026-BACnet">GNU remotecontrol &amp; BACnet</a>.

<h3 class="section">11.2 HVAC Original Equipment Manufacturer - Feature Addition</h3>

<p>OEM's have not added the feature of IP enablement in the past. The benefits for OEM's to add IP enablement to their thermostat product offering far outweigh any hindrance from remaining a standalone device. Examples of these benefits include interoperability, furthered energy management strategies, and increased customer satisfaction from the new capability of remote access to their thermostat.

<h3 class="section">11.3 HVAC Aftermarket Equipment Manufacturer - Feature Addition</h3>

<p>AEM's have added the feature of IP enablement in the past with limited success. This is mostly due to the dependency on another piece of proprietary technology to handle translation of some proprietary technology to the data network for the thermostat. The proprietary aspect of the technology will often bottleneck the success of that technology. The success of the thermostat as a complimentary good is well proven. There are hundreds of different programmable thermostats for sale at both the local home supply stores and globally. Proper selection of any aftermarket product or service is critical to the success of the primary product being supplemented. A simple example of this is selecting the different parts to enhance an engine for an automobile, or a boat, or a snow mobile, et cetera. Aftermarket Equipment Manufacturers must demonstrate they have in their offering the capability to not damage the existing primary product. Specifically, a heating and cooling system. There must also be solid proof their offering enhances system performance by adding additional feature/benefit combinations. Finally, their offering must be constructed to meet manufacturing directives, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROHS">RoHS</a>.

<h3 class="section">11.4 Cost Benefit Analysis</h3>

<p>The outcome of your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">Cost Benefit Analysis</a>  will help you see your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return">Return on Investment</a> (ROI). This will most likely be the bottom line to the success of GNU remotecontrol for you. The <a href="http://sccmet.com/whatis.html">Retro Commission</a> (RCx) of any facility, small or large, is best evaluated by.....<strong>is it worth it</strong>?  Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_Adjusting_Balancing">Testing-Adjusting-Balancing</a> a system is well worth the time and effort, to make sure your system is setup as suitable for your needs and wants. The answer to this ROI question mandates completing several different calculations to make that determination. New construction does not require as many calculations to come to that determination, but often mandates different aspects to be evaluated and then calculated. Don't forget to add in the cost/saving of Information Technology. This list includes system design, capital expenditures, and system operation. Then, don't forget to add in your End User cost/saving for training and system operation.

   <p>Not every facility must have a complete set of calculations to know what you need to do for your energy management strategy. Consider simple advice on best practices offered by your <strong>qualifed</strong> Decision Makers to help you select what is best for you. Regardless of what you choose for your energy management strategy, have a plan.....work the plan.....review and revise your plan, as appropriate.

   <p>The cost to implement GNU remotecontrol, in comparison with a lesser energy management strategy for any HVAC system, justifies the completion of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">Cost Benefit Analysis</a> to determine if GNU remotecontrol is appropriate for your circumstances. Most likely, it is.
