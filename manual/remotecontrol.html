<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>
<p>GNU remotecontrol is a web application serving as a management tool for multiple IP enabled HVAC thermostat devices and other Building Automation devices. The purpose of GNU remotecontrol is to read from and write to multiple IP enabled thermostat devices all at one time.
</p>
<p>The GNU remotecontrol framework is designed to work with any IP enabled HVAC thermostat, but can be easily developed to operate any number of networked devices. This framework is built with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL">cURL</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a>. This system architecture is enabled on a server-client principle, where users can login to the server using a web browser to manage multiple remote devices from a single web interface. The GNU remotecontrol framework was developed to work in combination with a Remote Monitoring Server, which monitors configurable device parameters and can generate automatic system responses and alerts. GNU remotecontrol is both scalable and distributable over multiple computers serving different roles in the HVAC or remote device management framework. The <a href="http://www.proliphix.com/">Proliphix</a> thermostat (currently the only true IP enabled HVAC thermostat on the market) was used to develop the GNU remotecontrol web application. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Application Programming Interface</a> (API) <strong>Proliphix IP Devices HTTP API, Revision 1.8</strong> is used to read from and write to the Object Identification (OID) numbers defined in the Proliphix API for the Proliphix HVAC thermostat device.
</p>
<p>We identify anytime we do not adhere to the Proliphix API instructions with the text...<strong>THIS IS A DEVIATION TO THE PROLIPHIX API</strong>...in GNU remotecontrol user manual. The only time we deviate from the Proliphix API is when there is a critical thermostat device firmware deficiency. Otherwise, the Proliphix API instructions are strictly followed by GNU remotecontrol.
</p>
<p>GNU remotecontrol is now designed and built using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a> (MVC) software architectural pattern. The benefit is to provide easier code reusability and pave the way for <strong>U</strong>nattended <strong>S</strong>erver <strong>S</strong>ide <strong>A</strong>utomation (<strong>USSA</strong> or <strong>U-S-S-A</strong>). The automation is intended to replace repetitive actions in your day-to-day usage of GNU remotecontrol. Examples of such repetition are setting the time on all thermostat devices, or interfacing with an external system such as another Energy Management System. The benefit is to free you of most, if not all, human interaction necessary to operate your GNU remotecontrol implementation.
</p>
<p>GNU remotecontrol is now designed and built using a standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_layer">Data-Access Layer</a> (DAL) interface via the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php">PHP Data Objects</a> (PDO). This construct supports the GNU remotecontrol MySQL database using the PDO data access components. The DAL can easily mature to support other types of databases or data access components.
</p>
<p>There are two significant enhancements to the setup of GNU remotecontrol. First, there is scripting to setup the GNU remotecontrol database. Second, there is a single configuration file to connect your PHP to your MySQL for using GNU remotecontrol along with other settings necessary for GNU remotecontrol. These two enhancements greatly ease GNU remotecontrol configuration and operation.
</p>
<p>The intended structure of this documentation is to help you achieve an understanding of <strong>why</strong> you need or want to use GNU remotecontrol and instruction for <strong>how</strong> to use GNU remotecontrol. Our research during the development of GNU remotecontrol found users operated best when they were given the opportunity to gain a high-level understanding of all the technologies associated with GNU remotecontrol. This documentation is written as a combined reference manual and technical manual for GNU remotecontrol. The <strong>Scope</strong> section contains a listing of the minimum recommended chapter reading, per user role. Each section in <strong>System Architecture and Concepts</strong> contains instructions for <strong>Security Model</strong>, any <strong>Options</strong> recommended, <strong>Requirements</strong> to run the technology, and <strong>Configuration</strong> of the technology.
</p>
<p>We recognize this documentation contains a lot of material. The documentation is segmented for you to select what you need to read to quickly and easily learn about and start using GNU remotecontrol. It is our hope you find this documentation contains all of the information you need to successfully and effortlessly use GNU remotecontrol. We now gladly give you the latest version of GNU remotecontrol.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Scope</h2>
<p>The scope of this documentation is to address the three roles (functional disciplines) who interact daily in the usage of GNU remotecontrol; <strong>Information Technology</strong>, <strong>Energy Management</strong>, and <strong>End User</strong>. A fourth role, <strong>Financial Management</strong>, is a role which operates in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">Cost Benefit Analysis</a> and in reviews to evaluate facility improvement opportunities. The documentation contains information pertinent to each role. The intended end result is to help equip each role with the necessary definitions and reference information to further high-level communication among the roles.

<h3 class="section">3.2 HVAC Thermostat</h3>
<p>It is necessary to understand the design and usage intent of the HVAC thermostat to fully grasp the design and usage intent of GNU remotecontrol.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostat">HVAC thermostat</a> device is often a combination of either a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay">relay</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device">semiconductor device</a> to have circuits either opened or closed, to switch the device either off or on. Examples of this functionality include heating, cooling, or a fan. The addition of a scheduling option to turn any of these items off or on at a certain time does make it more practical of a device in terms of managing day-to-day operation of any HVAC system. Adding in the ability to track run time duration for heating, cooling, or a fan help energy efficiency measurements. The final addition of remote access, through the traditional IP enabled data network, takes the HVAC thermostat to an interconnected device capable of multiple read and write operating functions. The cable from the thermostat to the HVAC equipment is solid core 18-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge">AWG</a>, either 4 or 8 separately jacketed wires, depending on system capability, all contained within a protective jacket.

<p>Being a licensed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_engineer">Professional Engineer</a> does not make the person a <a href="http://www.aeecenter.org/cem/">Certified Energy Manager</a> (CEM). They are separate qualifications, each with their own requirements. The titles associated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_engineering">Energy Engineering</a> are broad. Go with a Certified Energy Manager to help you determine if you qualify for any tax benefit for commercial building being rated as energy efficient. Even if you don&rsquo;t qualify for a tax benefit, it is highly likely you will find a beneficial set of methods to increase your Energy Management strategies which makes paying the Certified Energy Manager well worth the expense.

<h3 class="section">3.6 Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<a name="Why-do-we-call-it-GNU-remotecontrol_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.1 Why do we call it GNU remotecontrol?</h4>
<p>This code was originally called <strong>JUT</strong>.....&ldquo;<strong>J</strong>ust <strong>U</strong>se <strong>T</strong>his&rdquo; to represent the intention of this software automation to take the complicated and make it very, very simple, from a user perspective. The name changed to GNU remotecontrol, when code was released under the GNU license.
</p>
<a name="Why-do-I-need-GNU-remotecontrol_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.2 Why do I need GNU remotecontrol?</h4>
<p>If you have thermostat devices, you know it takes time and effort to keep your energy usage down and control your climate for your comfort. This time and effort is increased with each remote device or HVAC unit you want to administrate. GNU remotecontrol helps you spend less time and effort administrating your thermostat devices, provides automated record keeping of what changed, who changed it, and when it was changed. GNU remotecontrol deployment helps keep your energy usage as low as possible.
</p>
<a name="How-do-I-know-who-changed-what_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.3 How do I know who changed what?</h4>
<p>Review the access logs you have enabled for your Web Server, your Operating System, and all of the other technologies which achieve user validation of a web application. Technologies time tested, tried and true, which you can count on. No need to reinvent the wheel, use what works well when possible.
</p>
<a name="What-will-GNU-remotecontrol-do-for-me_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.4 What will GNU remotecontrol do for me?</h4>
<p>Free up your time and effort for starters. Also, enable you to know who did what to your thermostat devices when GNU remotecontrol was used to change your thermostat devices. Finally, your GNU remotecontrol application can help you minimize your energy costs.
</p>
<a name="Can-I-figure-my-energy-usage-for-my-HVAC-units_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.5 Can I figure my energy usage for my HVAC units?</h4>
<p>The IP enabled thermostat will greatly help with this measurement.
</p>
<a name="How-do-I-use-GNU-remotecontrol_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.6 How do I use GNU remotecontrol?</h4>
<p>Pretty easy, actually. Select the thermostat devices you want to change the settings of.....make the change.....and that&rsquo;s it. You can easily see the time and effort you save changing the air conditioning from 75&deg;F to 73&deg;F for several thermostat devices, all at once! Then, imagine changing your setback schedule somehow on top of that, for say thirty different thermostat devices, all at once!
</p>
<a name="Can-I-use-GNU-remotecontrol-and-Remote-Monitoring-Server-together_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.7 Can I use GNU remotecontrol and Remote Monitoring Server together?</h4>
<p>Oh, yes. Think of GNU remotecontrol as writing to your thermostat devices while a Remote Monitoring Server reading information about your thermostat devices. The two go hand in hand. They are intended to work together.
</p>
<a name="What-about-the-weather_002c-can-I-tie-weather-related-data-into-GNU-remotecontrol-and-Remote-Monitoring-Server_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.8 What about the weather, can I tie weather related data into GNU remotecontrol and Remote Monitoring Server?</h4>
<p>Yes. Use your Remote Monitoring Server to collect information about the weather from International Weather Services for the location of your thermostat device. This approach will tell you a great deal about the quality of your Energy Management strategy.
</p>
<a name="Mobile-access-for-GNU-remotecontrol_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.9 Mobile access for GNU remotecontrol?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can access GNU remotecontrol using your cell phone Internet browser.
</p>
<a name="Do-I-need-to-install-anything-to-my-computer_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.10 Do I need to install anything to my computer?</h4>
<p>No. GNU remotecontrol is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/">WC3</a> compliant web application. More times than not, your network is ready to go as-is.
</p>
<a name="How-many-different-users-will-be-able-to-use-GNU-remotecontrol_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.11 How many different users will be able to use GNU remotecontrol?</h4>
<p>You can set up different user accounts, but the nature of a thermostat device means the people touching it be extremely clear with each other as to how they want to set the thermostat device.
</p>
<a name="Encryption_002e_002e_002e_002e_002eis-GNU-remotecontrol-safe-to-use-with-my-network_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.12 Encryption.....is GNU remotecontrol safe to use with my network?</h4>
<p>We recommend you use a High Grade (AES-256 bit) encryption to secure the connection from your computer to your GNU remotecontrol server and verify the identity of your server with your own signed SSL Certificate. The connection from your computer to your thermostat device is not changed from your normal connection to your Proliphix thermostat device.
</p>
<a name="Is-GNU-remotecontrol-compatible-with-BACnet_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.13 Is GNU remotecontrol compatible with BACnet?</h4>
<p>Yes. See <a href="#GNU-remotecontrol-and-BACnet">GNU remotecontrol and BACnet</a>.
</p>
<a name="Can-I-use-GNU-remotecontrol-to-help-Test-and-Balance-my-HVAC-system_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.14 Can I use GNU remotecontrol to help Test and Balance my HVAC system?</h4>
<p>Yes. Remote Monitoring Server and GNU remotecontrol work together to help you do just this. Recorded data of your HVAC system&rsquo;s usage and outdoor weather information is priceless for testing and balancing. The review of recorded data offers considerable cost savings, in both time and effort, when optimizing your system setup. Additionally, you can reduce the number of people necessary to do the testing and balancing down to one person.
</p>
<a name="Future-Capabilities"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.7 Future Capabilities</h3>
<p>The next logical step is to expand GNU remotecontrol and become certified with industrial HVAC, lighting control, access control, and fire detection technologies. The BACnet communication protocol is an excellent candidate for connection to the GNU remotecontrol framework. See <a href="#GNU-remotecontrol-and-BACnet">GNU remotecontrol and BACnet</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus">MODBUS</a> communication protocol may also be implemented at a future date, but demand for this capability enhancement is not clearly understood.

<p>The <a href="http://www.bacnet.org/">BACnet</a> data communication protocol, for Building Automation and Control Networks, was developed by <a href="http://www.ashrae.org/">ASHRAE</a>, the building technology society. The intention is to enable interoperability between automation and control systems by different vendors used in the building industry.
</p>
<a name="Associated-Specifications"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.2 Associated Specifications</h3>
<p>BACnet conformance requires a <strong>P</strong>rotocol <strong>I</strong>mplementation <strong>C</strong>onformance <strong>S</strong>tatement (<a href="http://www.bacnet.org/DL-Docs/">PICS)</a>, which GNU remotecontrol does not currently have. This is because we have no user requests to develop GNU remotecontrol in this direction. However, the PHP code can be adapted to utilize the XML language to effect communication with BACnet systems and compliant devices. GNU remotecontrol is capable of processing packets comprising the BACnet model and its Object types, by utilizing PHP code to parse the data and handle inputs and outputs and network communications as BACnet requires.
</p>
<a name="Going-Forward"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.3 Going Forward</h3>
<p>The roadmap of GNU remotecontrol is a commitment to International standards and protocols for Information Technology to provide availability, relevance, transparency, and maintenance of the GNU remotecontrol framework. (See <a href="#Roadmap">Roadmap</a>.) The BACnet <a href="http://www.bacnet.org/WG/XML/index.html">XML Working Group</a> is an excellent example of these attributes.

This section has a list of <strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>, at the end. If your answer brings you peace of mind to not have a Remote Monitoring Server, so be it. Perhaps you trust the decisions and work of others enough to not bother with setting up a Remote Monitoring Server. That is often a poor choice.
</p>
<p>Running a Remote Monitoring Server is the easy part of having a Remote Monitoring Server. The biggest decision you have to make is.....<strong>are you going to run it, or is someone else</strong>? Then, and only then, choose the technology combination you want to have for your Remote Monitoring Server. Do not let your skill set alone decide what is best for meeting your needs. Determine what you needs are, count the cost, and then choose your technology.

<p>We developed a complementary set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_%28computing%29">plugins</a> to round out the GNU remotecontrol Architecture. The plugins can be implemented either individually or collectively. We developed our plugins in accordance with the <a href="https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html">Nagios Plugin Development Guidelines</a>. The function of these plugins is to capture and process numerical characters from data obtained from your IP enabled thermostat device and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> feeds for weather information out of doors.

<a name="Proliphix-Alarms"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.4.1 Proliphix Alarms</h4>
<p>The need for the <strong>Thermostat Plugin - check_ubicom</strong> is better understood when the limitations of the native Proliphix alarms are examined. The Proliphix thermostat device has four alarms.
	</p><ul>
<li> Low Temperature
	</li><li> High Temperature
	</li><li> High Humidity
	</li><li> Filter Change
	</li></ul>

<p>Alarms in the thermostat device were considered for displaying in GNU remotecontrol <strong>home.php</strong> or another web page not yet developed (perhaps something like a GNU remotecontrol alarms.php web page). Feedback from users during development of GNU remotecontrol showed their preference is to be informed of alarms from a Remote Monitoring Server notification. This approach also provides logging of all monitored information, a feature not available in the thermostat device itself.
</p>
<p>The Temperature and Humidity alarms are already provided for in the Nagios checks we have developed. The Filter Change alarm has various pre-determined options to select; 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, 365 Runtime Days. This does not account for dust accumulating on a filter, should the power be turned off to the thermostat device. This logic combination is determined as insufficient to use for monitoring when to change the filter of any HVAC system. Reasoning for this determination includes:
	</p><ul>
<li> Various pollutants enter filters at different times in different ways.
	</li><li> Allergens are more prevalent in the Spring compared to the other seasons of the year.
	</li><li> Dust is more common if a manufacturing facility has dust as a by-product of manufacturing.
	</li><li> Dust is generated from Wood Stoves and Fire Places. Heating needs often change throughout the year.
	</li><li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm">Dust Storms</a> are common in arid and semi-arid regions. Dust Storms require additional filter inspections to make sure equipment will not be damaged from improper ventilation.
	</li><li> An end-user is the best person to determine when to change a filter based upon the environmental conditions which may or may not change.
	</li></ul>

<p>The Proliphix API only supports reading these alarms, not setting an alarm threshold or resetting an alarm event. The user must go to the web page within the Proliphix thermostat device for setting an alarm threshold or resetting an alarm event. Also, there is only a single alarm issued per alarm type until the alarm type event is reset in the thermostat device. This logic combination means a threshold may be exceeded, return to an acceptable level for the user, and then be exceeded again. This example is an excellent illustration of the value gained by having a Remote Motoring Server, with its fully configurable and flexible alarm functionality, watching your network, your devices, and anything else you can monitor.
</p>
<p>Finally, since the thermostat device has a threshold of how many read events the unit can support per minute, we did not want to overwhelm the device with multiple read events. An example of this overwhelming of the device is:
	</p><ol>
<li> Having a separate web page, somewhere, for viewing these alarms, after they are read from the thermostat device.
	</li><li> Then, returning to the GNU remotecontrol <strong>home.php</strong> web page, to see those alarms.....again.
	</li><li> Then, going into the thermostat device web page, to clear the alarm or adjust thresholds.
	</li><li> Then, going back to the GNU remotecontrol <strong>home.php</strong> web page, to see what an alarm reads.
	</li><li> Then, going back into the separate web page, somewhere, to see what an alarm reads.
	</li></ol>

<p>The Proliphix API is quite distinct about this cautioning of too many read events per minute through the Proliphix API. The combination of the web server of the thermostat device and GNU remotecontrol <strong>home.php</strong> is a proper approach to use and not overwhelm the thermostat device. This approach caches the data and avoids repeated Proliphix API calls to the Proliphix HVAC thermostat device.

<h4 class="subsection">6.4.2 Thermostat Plugin - check_ubicom</h4>
<p>Please review the documentation provided with the plugin source code for detailed usage instructions. The following is an outline of the detailed instruction.
</p>
<p>This plugin will attempt to read temperature and humidity from a thermostat device. Successful reads initially set the response to <code>STATE_OK</code>. If the temperature or humidity falls outside the range set by the <code>warn-temperature</code> or the <code>warn-humidity</code> arguments, then the response is upgraded to <code>STATE_WARNING</code>. If the temperature or humidity falls outside the range set by the <code>critical-temperature</code> or the <code>critical-humidity</code> arguments, then the response is further upgraded to <code>STATE_CRITICAL</code>. Failure to read both values, due to either a timeout or parsing failure, results in a <code>STATE_UNKNOWN</code> response.

<h3 class="section">6.5 Email Server</h3>

<a name="Security-Model-3"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.5.1 Security Model</h4>
<p>GNU remotecontrol is configured with the minimum level of security necessary for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_server">Email Server</a>. You are responsible for setting up your security on your Email Server.
</p>
<a name="Requirements-3"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.5.2 Requirements</h4>
<p>The email send function used in the GNU remotecontrol Architecture is for sending email from your Remote Monitoring Server to you, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP">SMTP</a>. The mail send function will use the server&rsquo;s Mail Transfer Agent (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_transfer_agent">MTA</a>). Requirements for High Availability of mail sending necessitate the configuration of a secondary MTA to provide service redundancy. You will need to have your own registered Domain Name with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record">MX record</a>, to be able to send email messages directly to recipients and not be blocked by various Internet Service Providers (ISPs), for fear of spam. Follow the requirements stated by the Email Server application you so choose to use with your Remote Monitoring Server.
</p>
<a name="Options-2"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.5.3 Options</h4>
<p>Many ISPs block outgoing packets through port 25. This occurs as a matter of course to minimize spam. If you ISP is blocking port 25, then you have the option.....and is <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</strong> for security purposes.....to configure your MTA to use SSL/TLS encryption when sending messages to remote mail servers (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smtps">SMTPS</a>). This configuration would normally use a different port than port 25 for outgoing messages, overcoming the problem of blocked port 25. If your server is not operating under a registered Domain Name, then you have no option but to use a third party SMTP service offered by different ISPs (e.g. DynDNS Email, Gmail, et cetera) to relay messages from your Remote Monitoring Server server to the intended recipients, via your email account on the third party server.
</p>
<p>Do yourself a <strong>big</strong> favor and become clear on these three items:
	</p><ul>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_Delivery_Agent">Mail Delivery Agent</a>
	</li><li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_transfer_agent">Mail Transfer Agent</a> (Mail Relay)
	</li><li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_user_agent">Mail User Agent</a>
	</li></ul>

<p>Then, do yourself a <strong>huge</strong> favor and become familiar with these four items:
	</p><ul>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_authentication">Email Authentication</a>
	</li><li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME">S/MIME</a>
	</li><li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP_Authentication">SMTP Authentication</a>
	</li><li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a>
	</li></ul>
	

<p>Now, having a familiarity understanding of these items will equip you to have a successful talk with your Email Administrator, or your Internet Service Provider, or a Mail Relay Provider. They will ask you several questions about how you want email handled for your GNU remotecontrol. Prepare beforehand for this discussion. The discussion will go much better if you are familiar with and understand these items.
</p>
<a name="Configuration-3"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.5.4 Configuration</h4>
<p>The Remote Monitoring Server can be configured to send notifications to any number of different recipients. It is advisable you configure the access control list of your Email Server to only allow messages to be sent from the user under which your Remote Monitoring Server is running, as an added security precaution. Follow the requirements stated by the MTA application you so choose to use and the settings provided by any third party SMTP service.
</p>
<p>The email you probably want to receive is that which will notify you of a condition occurring. You are notified by email messages sent to you by your Remote Monitoring Server. You do not have to keep these email notifications after you are notified, nor do you need to set any reports to be sent to you in more emails. All of the information you would ever need about notifications, alerts and their history, is being stored on your Remote Monitoring Server, either in log files or in a database. The benefit of receiving an email alert is to be notified in real time, when you need to look into an exception event to mitigate its impact. The benefit of this awareness is priceless.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Don&rsquo;t use an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service">SMS</a> address when sending email to cell phones. Use the cell phone&rsquo;s email address via the <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/email-to-sms/">Free Email To SMS Gateways</a>. Major United States Carriers offer this to both email or SMS users. Look for the same options from cell phone providers where you live. You will be much happier using the cell phone&rsquo;s email address, as you can easily track if the message went out or not, versus wondering about the SMS system.....in which knowing is often a mystery. Finally, it is one less system to use.

<a name="Frequently-Asked-Questions-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">6.6 Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<a name="What-is-RMS_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.1 What is RMS?</h4>
<p>RMS is the acronym of Remote Monitoring Server.
</p>
<a name="What-is-Remote-Monitoring-Server_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.2 What is Remote Monitoring Server?</h4>
<p>A Remote Monitoring Server regularly keeps track of your chosen networked device (computers, email servers, web servers, routers, thermostat devices, et cetera) and notifies you with alerts of any problems when they occur.
</p>
<a name="Why-do-I-need-RMS_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.3 Why do I need RMS?</h4>
<p>If you want to know the status of any IP addressable device, you need to monitor it. If you do not have the time or effort available to stand there and watch the device yourself, you need something to automatically monitor it and record the results for you to review at your leisure. Ideally, the Remote Monitoring Server will promptly notify you of anything occurring you have defined as a problem. An automated technology which remotely monitors your equipment, commonly referred to as.....<em>stuff</em>.....and alerts you when there is a problem. This is RMS.
</p>	
<a name="What-will-RMS-do-for-me_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.4 What will RMS do for me?</h4>
<p>Watch your &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; and tell you when your &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; has a problem. It logs the results of the monitoring of your &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; for you to review in a web page based format. This approach will help you quickly figure out if something is wrong and what is wrong with your &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.
</p>
<a name="How-do-I-use-RMS_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.5 How do I use RMS?</h4>
<p>Pretty easy, actually. Setup your Remote Monitoring Server and decide what network and devices you want monitored. From there, you receive an email or SMS message to your cell phone when there is a problem.
</p>
<a name="Does-a-Remote-Monitoring-Server-do-graphing_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.6 Does a Remote Monitoring Server do graphing?</h4>
<p>Yes, it produces graphs providing a visual indication of the measurements taken, in configurable scale and units of measurement.
</p>
<a name="Mobile-access-for-RMS_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.7 Mobile access for RMS?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can access your RMS server using your cell phone Internet browser.
</p>
<a name="Is-it-difficult-to-use-RMS_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.8 Is it difficult to use RMS?</h4>
<p>No more difficult than receiving an email or SMS message when an alert occurs. Reports of historical events are available on the RMS served website, which includes a summary dashboard and detailed log tables and graphs.
</p>
<a name="How-many-emails-or-SMS-messages-will-I-get_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.9 How many emails or SMS messages will I get?</h4>
<p>More than enough for you to know if and when there is a problem. A notification system is almost limitless in how it can be configured for you. A good example is not receiving all SMS message in the middle of the night, but only the SMS messages you conclude you must have &rsquo;round the clock. When you receive a notification, how many times you receive a subsequent notification for the same failure, and who receives those notifications.....all set up as you want.
</p>
<a name="How-many-different-email-addresses-will-you-send-me-notifications-to_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.10 How many different email addresses will you send me notifications to?</h4>
<p>Often, there is a primary and a secondary person in a monitoring notification. Each person has an email address and an SMS address, receiving email or SMS notifications to each address.....as you prefer. Or, it is sent to a Distribution List. The combination of options are plentiful to send email, rest assured.
</p>
<a name="Can-I-use-RMS-to-help-Test-and-Balance-my-HVAC-system_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.11 Can I use RMS to help Test and Balance my HVAC system?</h4>
<p>Yes. RMS and GNU remotecontrol work together to help you do just this. Having recorded data for your system usage and outdoors weather information is priceless for testing and balancing. It offers considerable cost savings, in both time and effort, to review recorded data to optimize your system setup. Additionally, you can reduce the number of people necessary to do the testing and balancing down to one person.
</p>
<a name="Do-I-need-RMS_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.12 Do I need RMS?</h4>
<p>Not to sound silly, but RMS prevents a mess. It is impossible to consciously improve anything without first measuring it. You may stumble upon a way to improve it, but is that a pro-active approach to managing anything? Of course not. To help improve things, RMS helps by monitoring the status your resources. The unknown things of life can crop in and cause problems. The faster you know about a problem, the faster you can stop any damage the problem may cause. RMS helps you take advantage of the opportunity to improve how you manage things, so the chance of a problem returning becomes less likely.
</p>
<a name="Really_002c-how-do-I-know-that-I-need-RMS_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">6.6.13 Really, how do I know that I need RMS?</h4>
<p>If you worry about your &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;, and your &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; has an IP address, you need RMS.

<a name="Time"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.2 Time</h3>
<p>This section is quite important, perhaps the most important of all. The absence of all devices being set to the same time often results in many problems, problems which are often catastrophic in nature. We have written this section to try to eliminate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_synchronization">Clock Synchronization</a> errors from hindering the efficiency of your Energy Management strategy.
</p>
<p>The definition of Time can mean many things to many people. We define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time">Time</a> as <em>a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them</em>. Date is a collection of time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">Daylight Savings Time</a> is the most common occurrence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_change">Time Change</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation">Time Dilation</a> is not a problem with HVAC operation, nor is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment">Hafele Keating Effect</a>, as the facility is not traveling.
</p>
<p>Examples of how time differences can cause damage and harm people are in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time#Complexity">manufacturing facility</a> and while using medical equipment. Awareness during the Daylight Savings Time change is the easiest way to avert any unforeseen problems. Remember, even if you don&rsquo;t live in a location which observes Daylight Savings Time, there is still a time correction which occurs to resolve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94T">Delta T</a>. Finally, you may have newly installed equipment incorrectly configured during installation and erroneously activates the hourly time change when Daylight Savings Time occurs.
</p>
<p>All times within the database are stored using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a> time standard and converted to the user&rsquo;s time zone (based on their location) for display purposes. All HVAC devices have time specified in the device&rsquo;s time zone (based on its location). The time you choose on an HVAC device setting is relative to the device&rsquo;s time zone.
</p>
<p>Use the Time Administration setting to update all active thermostat devices to make sure all thermostat devices are set with the correct time for their time zone and Daylight Savings Time setting. A time update must be applied to all thermostat devices whenever the Daylight Savings Time change for the device&rsquo;s location.

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.4 Usage</h4>
<p>This web page displays all of your active thermostat devices. View your inactive thermostat devices on the <strong>Undelete Thermostats</strong> web page, generated by the <strong>admin-undelete.php</strong> file. Activate an inactive thermostat device to display the thermostat device in <strong>home.php</strong>.
</p>
<p>Any user account visiting <strong>home.php</strong> without first establishing locations is redirected to <strong>admin-location.php</strong>. Any user account visiting <strong>home.php</strong> without first establishing groups is redirected to <strong>admin-group.php</strong>. Establishing both groups and locations is a task of the GNU remotecontrol administrator user account. The first user account to login to GNU remotecontrol is set to <strong>Is Admin</strong> status. This status selection is regulated by visiting the <strong>admin-user.php</strong> file.
</p>
<p>This web page provides for viewing existing thermostat device settings stored in the thermostat device and writing new settings to the thermostat devices. Loading <strong>home.php</strong> causes each attribute of each thermostat device to be read. You only view the settings of a single thermostat device, one at a time. The data from a thermostat device is not loaded if the thermostat device cannot be reached or if the thermostat device is unresponsive. Click the <strong>Load</strong> option in the <strong>Action</strong> field to view the settings of a single thermostat device. This action will read the said thermostat device and load the thermostat device settings into this web page. Then, alter the thermostat settings as you prefer. Then, click the check box on the row of the thermostat device you want to apply these settings. You can apply settings to one, multiple, or all active thermostat devices.
</p>
<p>Selecting a collection of thermostat devices is easily accomplished by selecting them with their <strong>Group</strong> field entry. Click the hyperlink in the <strong>Group</strong> field to activate the check box field of the thermostat device record in the GNU remotecontrol database.
</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Submit</strong> button. GNU remotecontrol goes to each device, makes the changes you prescribe, and populates <strong>Historical Reporting</strong> and <strong>Exception List</strong> in the GNU remotecontrol database, as appropriate. A successful write event to the thermostat devices renders the message <strong>Settings applied successfully</strong> in the color of green. An unsuccessful write event to the thermostat device renders the message <strong>Error</strong> in the color of red. The exact message from each thermostat device for each failed write event is captured. This capability enables you to then use <strong>history.php</strong> or <strong>admin-exception-list.php</strong> or Database Management for thermostat device diagnostics to identify if any thermostat device is changing settings, identifying if you need to investigate who is doing this changing, or if the device is problematic.
</p>
<p>There are <strong>five</strong> different fields available to easily manage your thermostat devices. You have <strong>two</strong> on the thermostat device; <strong>Device Name</strong> and <strong>Site Name</strong>. You have <strong>three</strong> in the GNU remotecontrol database; <strong>Group</strong>, <strong>Custom Name</strong>, and <strong>Description</strong>. You also have <strong>Model #</strong>, <strong>Address</strong>, and <strong>Username</strong> available in the GNU remotecontrol database, though they may not be considered an easy way to identify your thermostat devices. Plan out how you want to populate these fields, making your life much easier for managing your thermostat devices on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>You need to know the settings on the different IP enabled thermostat devices you are charged with managing. Using GNU remotecontrol will help you see if anyone or anything has changed the settings on a thermostat device, thereby altering or defeating your Energy Management strategy. Combining into the equation a Remote Monitoring Server with Email Server notification and you are on top of the game for Energy Management.
</p>
<p>Reload <strong>home.php</strong> at any time you prefer to poll each thermostat device and read the current parameters of the attributes for all thermostat devices.
</p>
<p>All user types can access this web page.

<p>We added a means of user control to this web page, per a request received during our design of GNU remotecontrol. The demand for this feature is the desire to increase awareness of the need to also setup Remote Monitoring for a newly added thermostat device. The intent of this feature is to provide a check and balance for all roles using GNU remotecontrol. Imagine adding a thermostat device to your facility and forgetting to setup monitoring of the thermostat device, only to find out after a month or so has passed you have no information collected for this newly added thermostat device. This feature helps to remind you to setup monitoring of the thermostat device when you add more thermostat devices to your facility. You set the total number of thermostat devices each user account is allowed to whatever you prefer. This collectively provides for a separation of duties between the GNU remotecontrol administrator and the GNU remotecontrol user. This separation of duties greatly helps to structure change management in your environment between the different people in your organization.

<p>GNU remotecontrol can operate on a laptop, a desktop, even a hand-held computer.....if you can achieve setting up your Web Server and Database Server.
</p>
<p>It will probably be much easier on you to setup a GNU remotecontrol system while using your existing Energy Management Control System. This will allow you to learn, test, try, think, try some more, all side-by-side with all of your existing systems. Then, when you are ready, switch over seamlessly to use GNU remotecontrol as your primary system, along with your (then) old Energy Management Control System, to make sure you are absolutely comfortable with your setup of your GNU remotecontrol system. Finally, once your are comfortable with your GNU remotecontrol, decommission your old Energy Management Control System.

<p>Benefits of running GNU remotecontrol on a smaller hardware combination include:
	</p><ul>
<li> Getting GNU remotecontrol up and running for a Proof-of-Concept.
	</li><li> Managing the HVAC systems of different sites without having to be at each of those sites.
	</li></ul>

<h3 class="section">8.2 Strongly Encouraged</h3>
<ul>
<li> Restrict your data network to only allow a few network addresses to connect to the IP enabled thermostat devices. This makes sure the IP enabled thermostat devices does not get overloaded from too many users trying to access it where it fails to respond, possibly requiring the IP enabled thermostat devices to be power cycled. Instead, use the logged data of by minute and by quarter hour to run your monitoring and reporting.
	</li><li> Setup your Remote Monitoring Server to log sensor readings every minute. Do this for fifteen concurrent minutes. Delete previous records so you only have the fifteen readings in this record set at any given time. Then, you have a granular recording of data in combination with your Remote Monitoring Server recording the same information in fifteen-minute intervals. It takes about a minute for a change to register on a sensor, shy of an extreme combination of circumstances. This sensor reading approach provides you with all of the monitoring and reporting data you could ever hope for.
	</li><li> Script setting the time on your IP enabled thermostat devices. Recommend setting the time every month, at a minimum. Clocks of all kinds are always gaining or losing a few seconds here and there, to the point things add up to a few minutes here and there. Setting the time on a regular monthly basis avoids the whole gaining and losing problem.
	</li><li> Roaming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_%28electricity%29">Brown Outs</a> and Natural Disasters in the vicinity of your thermostat devices cause for your thermostat devices to have all kinds of power supply problems. Your thermostat device may well have a weak on-board battery. That means the time on your thermostat has a poor chance of being correct and any Setback Scheduling on the device has little to no chance of being properly executed. Set the time every hour on your thermostat device, at the minimum. The fact a Natural Disaster has occurred means your Energy Management strategy will be unable to occur, anyway. Plan some type of HVAC Settings for dealing with a Natural Disaster. Perhaps a plan for the Winter months and a plan for the Summer months. Perhaps turning on the fan for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_%28architecture%29">Architecture Ventilation</a> is the best course of action, promoting health and safety in the facility. Perhaps activating heating or cooling is also in the best course of action. Use scripting to help you meet this need.
	</li><li> Use Database Management to change the time in the thermostat profile when Daylight Savings Time occurs. For example, Database Management will convert North America Eastern Standard Time, with a UTC offset of -5, to North America Eastern Daylight Time, with a UTC offset of -4. Remember, there is Australian Eastern Time and North American Eastern Time, each with Daylight and Standard options. Clearly, the database aspect of GNU remotecontrol will help you keep all of your time settings correct. Set it up as a SQL script to change the Time Zone entry in the thermostat profile. Run the script when Daylight Savings Time occurs.
	</li><li> Script setting your heating-cooling-ventilation levels as a comparison of outdoors conditions. Say so many degrees difference between outside and inside, same for a difference in percentage of relative humidity.
	</li><li> Use the Remote Monitoring of your location to change a <a href="http://css-tricks.com/using-weather-data-to-change-your-websites-apperance-through-php-and-css/">website appearance</a>.
	</li><li> Use the Remote Monitoring of your location to build <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget">Software Widgets</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget">Web Widgets</a>.
	</li><li> Setup a simple web page which will fit the temperature and humidity readings of both the thermostat devices and the weather conditions you care about onto the screen of your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbrowser">cell phone</a>. You then can easily see, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web">in a single viewing</a>, what you care to know.

<a name="Use-Case-Scenarios-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">9 Use Case Scenarios</h2>
<p>The following are real examples, with abstract names, to illustrate how to put all of this technology together so it will work for you.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-1-_002d-Building-Maintenance"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.1 Scenario 1 - Building Maintenance</h3>
<p>This person is overworked and underpaid at the <strong>ABC Corporation</strong>. They have a boss that all the time wants to know if &ldquo;thus and so&rdquo; got done. This person needs a way to get things done faster and have automated documentation that it is complete.
</p>
<p>This person uses GNU remotecontrol to help with setting the HVAC in this company, and does a screen shot of the transaction history for their boss to see, as their boss wants an email to see what happens.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-2-_002d-Office-Worker"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.2 Scenario 2 - Office Worker</h3>
<p>This person is overworked and underpaid at <strong>Super-Duper Insurance Company</strong>. They haves a boss that all the time wants to know if &ldquo;thus and so&rdquo; got done. They need a way to get things done faster and have automated documentation that it is complete.
</p>
<p>They use GNU remotecontrol to help with setting the HVAC in this company, and does a screen shot of the transaction history for their boss to see, as their boss wants an email to see what happens.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-3-_002d-Property-Manager"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.3 Scenario 3 - Property Manager</h3>
<p>This person is overworked and underpaid at <strong>Manage 4 You Property Management Corporation</strong>. They have a boss that all the time wants to know if &ldquo;thus and so&rdquo; got done. This person needs a way to get things done faster and have automated documentation that it is complete.
</p>
<p>This person uses GNU remotecontrol to help with setting the HVAC in the properties to achieve considerable savings on energy cost, and does a screen shot of the transaction history for their boss to see, as their boss wants an email to see what happens.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-4-_002d-Restaurant-Operations"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.4 Scenario 4 - Restaurant Operations</h3>
<p>This person is doing pretty well in life. This person owns several restaurants around town called <strong>Super Good Eats</strong>. Each site has two different HVAC units. This person also setup a thermostat in their house. Later, they needed to care for their elderly mother, so they put a thermostat in the house of their mother. When this person sets the thermostat in their house, they set the house of their mother the same way. This way, this person knows pretty well how things are in the house of their mother, even though they are not there with their mother.
</p>
<p>The corporate office is all of the time messing with the thermostat and there is a lot of inner-office politics from this problem. This person wanted that problem to go away, and to quit paying through the nose in electric bill to keep the air conditioning going. This person set&rsquo;s the corporate office the same as their home, so they know the climate in the office pretty is much the same as the climate in their home. The owner can now can shut down arguments often before they occur.
</p>
<p>This person is saving so much money on energy costs they were able to buy a cabin in the mountains for when they and their family want to get away from the ocean front, where they live. This person remotely sets the temperature before they arrive at their cabin. The owner also makes sure that the temperature and humidity in their cabin is not too extreme when they are away, so pipes don&rsquo;t burst, and that there is not a mold or mildew problem.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-5-_002d-Certified-Energy-Manager"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.5 Scenario 5 - Certified Energy Manager</h3>
<p>The Certified Energy Manager (CEM) needs to manage multiple sites for multiple customers. The CEM needs to log data over a long time period. The CEM needs to adjust set-points on different HVAC equipment to work out the specific energy control measures for each customer. The CEM has multiple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Digital_Control">Direct Digital Control</a> (DDC) points. The CEM needs to know a great deal of information from these DDC points. The CEM could greatly benefit from having all of this information coming to them in a structured manner, all stored in a database, leveraging their already existing Information Technology to access and manage this collection of resources.
</p>
<p>The CEM can setup GNU remotecontrol over different computers. The Web Server, Database Server, Email Server, and Remote Monitoring Server are all separate from the CEM laptop. The CEM is free to travel and access GNU remotecontrol as necessary to adjust set-points, while receiving notifications something needs attention. The CEM is not bound to their office all day long.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-6-_002d-Industrial-Manufacturing-Facility"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.6 Scenario 6 - Industrial Manufacturing Facility</h3>
<p>This site has many different air-handling units, many different dampers, and several sources of heat. The facility has adequate staff to handle on-site maintenance. Please see the section above regarding the <strong>Certified Energy Manager</strong> to learn more about the aspect of accessing and managing Direct Digital Control (DDC) points.
</p>
<p>The benefit here is using GNU remotecontrol to decrease reaction time when Remote Monitoring finds a temperature or humidity threshold is close to being reached and not interrupt manufacturing operations.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-7-_002d-Facility-Manager"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.7 Scenario 7 - Facility Manager</h3>
<p>This scenario is a refinement of the Industrial Manufacturing Facility illustration, but wider in scope than only manufacturing.
</p>
<p>The Facility Manager often does not have a Certified Energy Manager to work with them. Please see the section above regarding the <strong>Certified Energy Manager</strong> to learn more about the aspect of accessing and managing Direct Digital Control (DDC) points.
</p>
<p>This site has many different air-handling units, many different dampers, and several sources of heat. The facility has adequate staff to handle on-site maintenance. The benefit here is using GNU remotecontrol to decrease reaction time when Remote Monitoring finds a temperature or humidity threshold is close to being reached and not interrupt facility operations.
</p>
<p>Examples of their daily maintenance routine includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Cleaning thermostat devices and sensors after they get a build up of dust, oil, or other pollutants on them, defeating their ability to operate well or at all.
	</li><li> Assist with device calibrating efforts, as a hand-held thermostat and a networked sensor showing the same reading is always preferred.
	</li><li> Justifying HVAC upgrades, as appropriate, to different areas of the facility. Examples of this functionality include a fan, a compressor, a coil, or changing from constant air volume to a variable air volume terminal unit.
	</li><li> Managing workers to achieve these tasks.
	</li></ul>

<p>There are loads of reasons to implement automation in this facility. Mostly, to help the staff accomplish their work in a timely manner, and assure they have a way to schedule vacation time for the staff.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-8-_002d-External-Information"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.8 Scenario 8 - External Information</h3>
<p>See the <strong>Cautionary</strong> paragraph in the <strong>Power over Ethernet</strong> section. It is necessary to understand about powering a thermostat device for this scenario to make sense. There are countless ways to bring external information sensors into your IP enabled thermostat device and use your Remote Monitoring Server to get that data to you.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-9-_002d-Financial-Manager"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.9 Scenario 9 - Financial Manager</h3>
<p>The Financial Manager is the person who has spending authority over the facility. Month after month, they have high electric and fuel bills because their facility is running either too hot or too cold due to an inability to effectively operate the HVAC systems. They do not have separate meters to know what part of the facility is using however much electricity or fuel. They simply have to do something, as they cannot justify these high expense every month. They lead a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">Cost Benefit Analysis</a> for their facility, leveraging the staff working at the facility, a Certified Energy Manager, off-site staff, and anyone else they need to complete their Cost Benefit Analysis. The end result is to know if GNU remotecontrol will help them lower their electric and fuel bills. Most likely, it will.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-10-_002d-Automated-Meter-Reading"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.10 Scenario 10 - Automated Meter Reading</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_meter_reading">Automated Meter Reading</a> is not the same as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter">Smart Metering</a>. They are both part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter#Advanced_metering_infrastructure">Advanced Metering Infrastructure</a>. Smart Metering has much more capability than Automated Meter Reading. Suffice it to say, if you are going to implement either of these technologies, it only makes sense to be able to do something with all of this data. Responding by changing your HVAC system, as appropriate, considerably helps to increase the effectiveness of you Energy Management strategy. Connect your Remote Monitoring Server to the data coming in from your Automated Meter Reading or Smart Metering so you can compare the data to the rest of the data you are capturing. You will have a clear picture of how much energy you are using to achieve your Energy Management strategy.
</p>
<a name="Scenario-11-_002d-Smart-Metering"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.11 Scenario 11 - Smart Metering</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter">Smart Metering</a> is not the same as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_meter_reading">Automated Meter Reading</a>. They are both part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter#Advanced_metering_infrastructure">Advanced Metering Infrastructure</a>.

</p>
<a name="Scenario-12-_002d-Utility-Providers"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.12 Scenario 12 - Utility Providers</h3>
<p>This provider has decided to offer an Energy Management service to their customer. They have thousands and thousands of customers. They need a way to help their customer manage their thermostat device for generating heating and cooling, but also maintain air flow in their residential and commercial facilities. This provider also needs to improve their ability to monitor energy consumption, plan for energy manufacturing, and manage emergencies such as roaming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_%28electricity%29">Brownouts</a> caused by storms and other catastrophic events. Please see the section <strong>Usage Recommendations</strong> for more information.
</p>
<p>Turning off all power to the HVAC system as a whole removes the ability of the HVAC fan to circulate air and maintain air flow. This defeats the Energy Management strategy, as circulating some amount of air necessary for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most importantly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Health_and_Safety">Environmental Health and Safety</a> has different ventilation requirements for residential, commercial, and industrial facilities.
</p>
<p>This provider has a two-part offering to their customers. First, the provider uses GNU remotecontrol to do more than just turn off the electricity, water, or fuel to the HVAC unit. They are now capable of providing either heating or cooling adjustments while having the HVAC fan circulate air, or only circulate air without a heating or cooling adjustment. This combination of options now available are much more than turning off the entire HVAC unit. Second, the provider also uses Smart Metering to connect HVAC usage with energy meter readings to log readings on an hourly basis. This combined offering provides for better control and usage of energy resources, HVAC resources, and visibility to understand customer energy usage. Energy usage as the billing cycle progresses and historically, of course. Imagine how happy the customer will be to be able to see this granular level of detailed billing.
</p>
<a name="Summary"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.13 Summary</h3>
<p>There is no single reason to implement GNU remotecontrol. The reasoning is often multiple and overlapping. All of these reasons help to decrease your costs and increase your comfort level. Think locally and globally, and you will easily see there is more good reasoning to use GNU remotecontrol than ever considered before.

</div>
<a name="Implementation-Cost-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">10 Implementation Cost</h2>
<p>The GNU remotecontrol framework leverages already existing Information Technologies of a Data Network, Web Server with a complete Operating System, Database Server, Remote Monitoring Server, and Email Server. The cost to implement GNU remotecontrol is then reduced to the following ordered list:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Labor to obtain and prepare GNU remotecontrol.
	</li><li> Labor to configure your already existing Information Technologies.
	</li><li> Purchase cabling to run from your data network to your IP enabled thermostat device.
	</li><li> Labor to install cabling from your data network to your IP enabled thermostat device.
	</li><li> Purchase IP enabled thermostat device.
	</li><li> Purchase a power supply for IP enabled thermostat device.
	</li><li> Labor to install IP enabled thermostat device.
	</li><li> Labor to install power supply for IP enabled thermostat device.
	</li><li> Labor to configure IP enabled thermostat device.
	</li></ol>

<p>It is highly recommended you choose external sensors for your IP enabled thermostat device having pre-wired cabling long enough to reach where you need the external sensor to reside. Adding in more cable between a device and an external sensor is often problematic. Mixing different cable types, in either quality of cable or type of cable.....or both.....often result with problems to having accurate sensor readings. This pre-wired cabling, per manufacturer design and intent of their sensor, decreases the likelihood of the sensor resulting with skewed metrics. Most external sensors are extremely touchy. This is a good thing, as it provides you with accurate metrics. However, proper cable selection of an external sensor is paramount to proper metrics. Go with the option of a manufacturer having enough cable as-built to meet your needs and not splicing on additional cable.
</p>
<p>Finally, consider the benefit of connecting your external sensor directly to your IP enabled thermostat device, provided the IP enabled thermostat device can accept it. The benefit of sensor averaging is highly valuable to improving system performance. A direct connection to the IP enabled thermostat device also eliminates the need for another power supply to operate the external sensor.
</p>
<p>The cost to implement GNU remotecontrol, in comparison with a lesser Energy Management strategy for any HVAC system, justifies the completion of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">Cost Benefit Analysis</a> to determine if GNU remotecontrol is appropriate for your circumstances. Most likely, it is.

</div>
<a name="Roadmap-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">11 Roadmap</h2>
<p>The working list of action items for GNU remotecontrol is posted in the <strong>TODO.txt</strong> file. This file is located in the <code>/PATH-TO-YOUR-SVN/remotecontrol/doc/</code> directory. These action items are specific changes we decide to accomplish and release in future versions. Each action item is loaded as either a <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=remotecontrol">Bug</a> or <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?group=remotecontrol">Task</a> into our <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/remotecontrol/">GNU Savannah section</a>. The GNU remotecontrol Road Map is planned for and limited by the following boundaries.
</p>
<a name="Interoperability"></a>
<h3 class="section">11.1 Interoperability</h3>
<p>The Future of GNU remotecontrol is a commitment to international standards and protocols for Information Technology to provide availability, relevance, transparency, and maintenance of the GNU remotecontrol framework. The BACnet <a href="http://www.bacnet.org/WG/XML/index.html">XML Working Group</a> is an excellent example of these attributes.
</p>
<a name="HVAC-Original-Equipment-Manufacturer-_002d-Feature-Addition"></a>
<h3 class="section">11.2 HVAC Original Equipment Manufacturer - Feature Addition</h3>
<p>OEM&rsquo;s now often have the feature of IP enablement. The benefits for OEM&rsquo;s to add IP enablement to their thermostat device product offering far outweigh any hindrance from remaining a standalone device. Examples of these benefits include interoperability, furthered Energy Management strategies, and increased customer satisfaction from the new capability of remote access to their thermostat device.
</p>
<a name="HVAC-Aftermarket-Equipment-Manufacturer-_002d-Feature-Addition"></a>
<h3 class="section">11.3 HVAC Aftermarket Equipment Manufacturer - Feature Addition</h3>
<p>AEM&rsquo;s have added the feature of IP enablement in the past with limited success. This is mostly due to the dependency on another piece of proprietary technology to handle translation of some proprietary technology to the data network for the thermostat device. The proprietary aspect of the technology will often bottleneck the success of this technology. The success of the thermostat device as a complimentary good is well-proven. There are hundreds of different programmable thermostat devices for sale at both the local home supply stores and globally. Proper selection of any aftermarket product or service is critical to the success of the primary product being supplemented. A simple example of this scenario is selecting the different parts to enhance an engine for an automobile, or a boat, or a snow mobile, et cetera. Aftermarket Equipment Manufacturers must demonstrate they have in their offering the capability to not damage the existing primary product. Specifically, a heating and cooling system. There must also be solid proof their offering enhances system performance by adding additional feature or benefit combinations. Finally, their offering must be constructed to meet manufacturing directives, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROHS">RoHS</a>.
</p>
<a name="Cost-Benefit-Analysis"></a>
<h3 class="section">11.4 Cost Benefit Analysis</h3>
<p>The outcome of your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">Cost Benefit Analysis</a> will help you see your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return">Return on Investment</a> (ROI). This will probably be the bottom line to the success of GNU remotecontrol for you. Additionally, consider your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_assets">Return on Assets</a> (ROA) as you consider your cost and benefits.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_service_company#Retro-commissioning">Retro Commission</a> (RCx) of any facility, small or large, is best evaluated by.....<strong>is it worth it</strong>? Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_Adjusting_Balancing">Testing-Adjusting-Balancing</a> a system is well worth the time and effort, to make sure your system is setup as suitable for your needs and wants. The answer to this ROI question mandates completing several different calculations to make this determination. The answer to this ROA question mandates defining how your investment is considered an asset.
</p>
<p>New construction does not require as many calculations to understand costs, but often mandates different aspects to be evaluated and then calculated. Don&rsquo;t forget to add in the costs and savings of Information Technology. This list includes system design, capital expenditures, and system operation. This is identified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_cost_transparency">IT Cost Transparency</a>. Then, don&rsquo;t forget to add in your End User costs and savings for training and system operation. This is identified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_accounting">Human Resource Accounting</a>.
</p>
<p>Not every facility must have a complete set of calculations to know what you need to do for your Energy Management strategy. Consider simple advice on best practices offered by your <strong>qualified</strong> Decision Makers to help you select what is best for you. Regardless of what you choose for your Energy Management strategy, have a plan.....work the plan.....review and revise your plan, as appropriate.
</p>
<p>The cost to implement GNU remotecontrol, in comparison with a lesser Energy Management strategy for any HVAC system, justifies the completion of a Cost Benefit Analysis to determine if GNU remotecontrol is appropriate for your circumstances. Most likely, it is.

<a name="Cabling-101"></a>
<h3 class="section">12.1 Cabling 101</h3>
<a name="Introduction-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>The intent of this writing is <strong>not</strong> to make you an expert in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable">cabling</a>. The intent is to provide you with the necessary reference information, tips, and recommendations for you to wisely use cabling. There is no, repeat.....no substitute for hands on experience with cabling.
</p>
<p>Please carefully read all of this information before you attempt your cabling efforts. Experience is a great teacher, so don&rsquo;t be afraid or discouraged if you mix up wiring patterns or do not suitably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_termination">terminate</a> a connection with the proper amount of pressure on a wire connector as you begin your cabling efforts.
</p>
<a name="Cable"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.2 Cable</h4>
<p>A wire is a single conductor. A cable is a group of two or more insulated conductors. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable">Category 5 cable</a> is available in many forms. The cable is solid core 24-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge">AWG</a>. 8 separately jacketed wires, twisted in pairs, making 4 pairs all contained within a protective jacket. The jacket wrapping around the cable is either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenum_cable">Plenum</a> or Non-Plenum. Plenum cable is rated for a fire hazard area. Category 5 cabling is often rated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_voltage">low-voltage</a>, meaning you do not need a license to install the cable. Please contact your local fire authority for more information.
</p>
<a name="Grounding"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.3 Grounding</h4>
<p>Proper cable grounding is essential for safety. The assumption the cable carries a low amount of voltage is true, but it also carries enough capability to damage the equipment connected together via your cable and you.....the cabling person. The differences between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_suppression">surge-suppression</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient-voltage-suppression_diode">transient-voltage-suppression</a> cannot be stated enough. Please contact your local fire authority for more information.
</p>
<a name="Installation"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.4 Installation</h4>
<p>Category 5 cable is installed in either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conduit">electrical conduit</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tray">cable trays</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=j-hooks">J-Hooks</a>. Cable must, must, must be properly supported to prevent stretching the copper wire and cause small breaks in the wire. Small wire breaks cause for performance issues in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality-of-service</a>, and lead to a complete breakage in one or more wires. Cable is laid out in a pattern of either a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_distribution_frame">main distribution frame</a> or an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_distribution_frame">intermediate distribution frame</a>.
</p>
<a name="Termination"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.5 Termination</h4>
<p>Properly installed cable is then connected with some type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack">registered jack -and- plug</a>. This end result is called a cable termination or a wire termination.
</p>
<a name="Testing"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.6 Testing</h4>
<p>All cabling must have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_test">continuity</a> all of the time. A simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tester">cable tester</a> is probably the most manageable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_tester">continuity tester</a> there is after cable has been terminated with a registered jack and plug to determine if you have continuity. If you have nothing else to test with, connecting two bare wires together with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_nut">wire nut</a> on one end, then testing the other ends with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter">multi-meter</a> is always an option. This is quite valuable after cable has been laid in place and you want to know if it has continuity before terminating the cable.
</p>
<a name="Usage-Notes"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.7 Usage Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li> You have the probability of good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality-of-service</a> after cable is properly installed, but it is not guaranteed. Wise planning of your installation is paramount to not having problems related to cabling.
	</li><li> Most cable installations go through some type of usage change during the lifecycle of the cable. Today, imagine you have a singe device connecting to a single port on your data network switch. Tomorrow, you may need more devices to connect to the same port on that same data network switch. That means you need to put another data network switch into the picture. Where that additional data network switch will reside is the unknown. Moving more data across that same cable means the quality of that cable, and the quality of installing that cable, really does matter. Sure, you can always pull more cable. However, you still need more ports on a data network switch that lives somewhere to connect those additional devices. Wise choices for cable installation provides more options to choose from, options that can easily increase cost effectiveness for owning and operating your equipment.
	</li><li> Your continuity tester will help you see when you have the proper wiring pattern and the proper amount of pressure on a wire termination.
	</li><li> A majority of the cables manufacturers post a required a minimum bend radius for their cable of, &quot;<em>four times the diameter</em>&quot; to avoid problems. A cable loop that is too small results in nothing more than broken cable. Small wire breaks cause for performance issues in quality-of-service. It is not worth installing lesser quality cable that will cause you problems, nor is it worth installing good cable in a way that will cause you problems. Plan your installation and you will have years of satisfaction from your cable.
	</li><li> Pull some extra cable, loop it in a circle, and wire tie the cable loop together. That provides for moving terminated cable a bit if necessary, and provides extra cable should you mix up things when you terminate the cable and need to correct the termination.
	</li><li> The satisfaction from installing your own cable is great, indeed. The cost of installing your own cable is sometimes best paid for through a cabling company. Count the cost and choose either your own labor or labor from a cabling company that best suits you requirements.
	</li><li> Remember, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality-of-service</a> is only possible after cable is properly installed.
	</li></ul>

<a name="Cautionary"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.1.8 Cautionary</h4>
<p>Whatever you do, always install your cable as required by your fire authority and always, always, always properly support your cable with either electrical conduit, cable trays, or J-Hooks. Suffice it to say, cable that is not properly supported will eventually have small cracks in the wire, resulting in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality-of-service</a> loss, progressing to intermittent continuity problems, and ultimately completely break the wire somewhere within the cable jacket.

<h3 class="section">12.2 Power over Ethernet (PoE) 101</h3>
<a name="Introduction-2"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.1 Introduction</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">Power over Ethernet</a> is quite possibly the best thing to come along to the Information Technology world of hardware since the 1980&rsquo;s. Literally, it is that wonderful! The essence of PoE is you can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable">cable</a> that is rated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_voltage">low-voltage</a> to power a multitude of PoE hardware <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Uses">devices</a>. The list of what is capable of PoE is constantly growing. Here are some common PoE terms to understand.
</p>
<a name="Power-Sourcing-Equipment-_0028PSE_0029"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.2 Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Power_sourcing_equipment">PSE</a> is the network PoE element that inserts power onto a Category 5 cable. It may be an endspan device, such as a PoE-enabled data network switch, or a midspan device located between the data network switch and the Powered Device (PD).
</p>
<a name="Powered-Device-_0028PD_0029"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.3 Powered Device (PD)</h4>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Powered_device">PD</a> is the PoE capable device that receives power over Category 5 cable. It could be a PoE-enabled IP telephone, a Wireless Access Point, an IP enabled HVAC thermostat, any other IP device that needs electrical power.
</p>
<a name="Midspan"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.4 Midspan</h4>
<p>A midspan device is a PSE that inserts power onto the Category 5 cable. It is situated between the data network switch and the PD. Typically, midspan devices are added to existing networks to allow the use of PoE-enabled PD&rsquo;s.
</p>
<a name="Endspan"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.5 Endspan</h4>
<p>An endspan device is typically a data network switch that incorporates PoE capabilities. Endspan devices often are implemented when a new network is created, to avoid adding both midspan devices and a data network switch.
</p>
<a name="Usage-Notes-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.6 Usage Notes</h4>
<p>Now, should you need or want to move a device such as a Wireless Access Point, an IP telephone, or an HVAC sensor to another location.....imagine how nice it would be to not have to juggle the powering of that device. There are many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet#Powering_devices">combination</a> options available for PoE capable hardware.
</p>
<p>Pressing onward, imagine a device is locked up and you need to power the device off and then turn it back on. Walking to that device could be a hassle, and could require opening a lot of access panels. Using PoE, you can turn off the power over your data network and then turn it back on.
</p>
<p>The thing for you with PoE is you need to determine how much electrical power you need. This amount will tell you what specification you need to comply with. The manufacturer of the PoE device will tell you what standards they are compatible with. From there, buy the PoE supply. Your selection is either a simple single-port power injector (Midspan), or a <a href="http://www.microsemi.com/products/powerdsine">rack-mounted</a> midspan power injector, or buy new data network switches that have PoE built-in as an integrated feature (Endspan). Count the cost and choose as best suits you.
</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of PoE is you have the ability to have a better handle on your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_suppression">surge-suppression</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient-voltage-suppression_diode">transient-voltage-suppression</a> efforts. This is because you so chose to install your cabling as recommended. Running a wire as an extension off of an HVAC unit, or a wall outlet, to supply electricity to power the PoE capable hardware, without also providing proper protection for that PoE hardware, is absolutely and positively nothing but trouble. That trouble often shows up as electrical damage in the form of peculiar performance of the hardware, or even hardware failure.
</p>
<a name="Cautionary-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">12.2.7 Cautionary</h4>
<p>Here is a strong and simple example of why powering your IP enabled thermostat device from an HVAC unit is a bad idea.
</p>
<p>The drain line on the HVAC unit somehow gets blocked. This triggers the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_switch">float switch</a> to prevent flooding and that powers down the whole system. The thermostat has then been turned off due to the absence of power to the thermostat. The same is true if you power your IP enabled thermostat device from your HVAC and not PoE. <strong>That means you will be unable to access your IP enabled thermostat device from your data network</strong>.
</p>
<p>You can also hook your float switch to your IP enabled thermostat device, as an external information sensor, and know when that float switch is activated via Remote Monitoring. Power over Ethernet is a really.....really.....good idea.
</p>
<p>Whatever you do, always use cable safely. Please contact your local fire authority for more information.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre></div>

<ol>
<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo; line with this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
